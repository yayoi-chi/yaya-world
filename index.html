Hello everypeep!
</p>

<p>
Since I have created by own GitHub account, I have decided to take over the repo for my website. Apparently, a README, which &ldquo;helps people interested in this repository understand your project&rdquo; was never created! I guess I never understood the importance of having a README until I took over the repo, so I make one now. Also, I suppose I <i>should</i> talk about what this repo is. I&rsquo;m sure no one is really interested in collaborating on it except maybe the person who is kindly hosting this on their server, but I&rsquo;ll explain what this is.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6a771f7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6a771f7"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What is Yaya&rsquo;s World?</h2>

Put simply, that&rsquo;s my personal website and blog. I originally created it to share guides for video games that I was playing. Guides I made myself&#x2026;well, if I&rsquo;m honest, it was originally only going to be one game, but&#x2026;.it exploded a bit. Now it has guides, even some finished one, reviews, and artwork. All of it is made by me. That&rsquo;s really all there is to it. Nothing fancy.

Well, you see, most of this is Hugo-related shtuff. Configuration and raw web page like shtuff. The website itself is really only storied in the <code>public</code> directory. Hugo allows me to write web pages in a more comfortable mark up language. Which is a combination of Markdown and Org-mode, and then deploy a static HTML site based on those pages. The <code>content</code> folder contains the actual raw pages.

To see this site first open a terminal in the document's root folder and type <code>hugo serve</code> than <a href="http://localhost:1313/~yayoi">go here</a>!
