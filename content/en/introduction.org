#+SUMMARY:

Hi hi 👋 You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over a year ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I am was completely addicted 🤪 If I'm honest, Fiesta Online isn't exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I've made friends and just can't seem to leave them. So I keep playing, even if I'm only slowly leveling one character 😅

I am typically seen running around on one of four characters, sometimes up to three at once 😵‍💫. I'll list them for you:

+ Yayoi_chi🏹 - Level 124
+ UiTamaki✝️ - Level 140
+ BabyYayo🏹 - Level 76
+ ToukaSatomi👻 - Level 106

Over the last year, I learned that the most fun I have is helping others. I often take UiTamaki out for random buff runs all over the world and just love helping friends with quests. I also have been a member of several guildes and picked up a few things from them, including some [[{{% ref guides %}}][guides]]. If you're looking for a friend, or someone to help you out, just find me in game. I'd be happy to help 😁

Though Fiesta is the game play most consistently, I am occasionally on other games, including other MMOs. Some MMOs I like are Final Fantasy XIV, Tower of Fantasy, and Ys Online. Chances are, if you run into a character named Yayoi, YayoiChi, Yayoi Chi, or something similar than I'm playing her! MMOs aren't all I play, I'm also a big fan of retro games, like Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers, and JRPGS, my favorite of which is the Xenosaga Saga and Persona series. In fact, I love these games so much, I've added some guides from them!

Also, I make a pretty good friend. If you happen to be on Steam, Mastodon, or Matrix, you can add me. I put links to my profiles on the bottom of the site. You can use these and the e-mail link to get in touch with suggestions or issues with the site as well, though a prefer to hear about page specific problems in their comments, thank you!
