The year is 2021, the month is November, and the setting is the game we all know and love: Fiesta Online. An idea hatched to create a character by the name of _Egg.

Fast-forward to the present: _Egg is *dancing* by one of her favourite little Elderine friends, Marionette Edge. Their bright attire and colourful hair stand out amongst the crowd. A passerby asks about the runic aura that surrounds them.
"I got it from a Kingdom Quest some years ago, but it's no longer available. " solemnly responds _Egg, "I've heard it's supposed to make its way back someday, though I'm not sure when."

After responding to their query, Edge and _Egg wander off to meet a stray pig on the outskirts of Elderine. _Egg runs up to hug the little piggie as Edge follows behind. They spend some time rolling around in the mud and enjoying the *summer* heat.
"Look at you, all dirty! Maybe we should visit the beach to rinse off," suggests Edge.

The two begin their hike past the Elderine guard spearmen, guard archers and through Forest of Mist, before reaching Sand Beach. They splash in the water, cleaning off and collecting starfish and clams. As they admire the push and pull of the ocean, they hear footsteps approaching. _Egg's husband, _Toast, walks toward them with colourful heart-shaped *balloons* in hand.

"Happy Birthday, my love! You're so far from home it took me a while to find you," exclaims _Toast, "Why don't we head back and sit by the stadium to watch the sunset?"
"I can make a picnic for us!" Suggests Edge excitedly.

The three make their way back to Elderine, stopping by a bed of flowers to admire their beauty. _Egg rarely finds her way outside the Elderine walls. She looks at her husband and her friend, soaking in the moment until they reach the front gates.

"Home sweet home," sighs _Egg. The trio walk to the stadium stairs and set up their picnic, enjoying the view of the town below them. They share stories and snacks as the sun sets, recounting their love for the town and its inhabitants. Perhaps tomorrow _Egg will go on another adventure, whether that be within the town walls standing next to people with descriptive names (_Egg enjoys "turning into" an _Egg McMuhffin, HardcoreFarmer _Egg, Sulking _Egg etc.) or outside the gates to face the merciless mobs, _Egg knows that her companions are good eggs and they'll keep her safe.
