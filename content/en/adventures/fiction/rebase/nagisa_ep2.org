* But I'm Not a Gamer
When I interviewed for this company as a virtual idol I thought it meant that I would just be singing with the added bonus that no one would see who I was. After the interview I got a bit of a bigger picture. Idols did more than sing!

It was about an hour before my next scheduled live stream. I sat in front of the computer. The new desk chair the company had sent over made me feel like a little kid who still had to sit in daddy's lap just to see the monitor. I tried to adjust it so it would sit just a bit higher, but, seeing as I was just four feet ten inches tall, this would almost leave my feet dangling. /If only they sent a shorter desk too,/ I remember thinking to myself.

I managed to get the chair adjusted to where I could see the screen and decided to try and tuck my legs up on the cushion. I would be setting up to play a racing game and I knew that I could play it with a controller, so reaching the keyboard or the mouse wasn't a high priority right now. Still, I wasn't really able to find a comfortable position. I thought about just getting my old chair, the one I during debut, but that was just a folding metal chair with almost no padding and management was expecting me to stream for at least a few hours.

"/Any chance of getting a shorter desk?/" I joked in a message to my manager.

"/I could look into it/," she replied.

"/I'll manage,/" I sent back.

"/If you're uncomfortable, it won't be good for you or your audience./"

"/Okay, look into it please. No rush though, I'll manage for today ðŸ˜‰/"

"/Okay, just remember, we discussed going for at least three hours today,/" the manager said.

"/I know./"

"/But its about you so make sure to pace yourself and don't go too long. If you have to end stream a bit early then do so./"

"/Thank you ðŸ˜„/" I sent.
