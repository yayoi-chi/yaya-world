I am Keyrie Cildor. I come from a privileged and noble line of wood elves. I am not large of stature, standing at only five feet and a single inch as measured by the humans, but I have a fierce heart for adventure.

My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world. The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity. It is my responsibility to respect the authority of those above just as expect from those below. I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling and privilege of my family. I am loyal to my sovereign and my subjects regard me as a hero. Though loyal and respectful in person, I often find thoughts of privilege creeping into my mind reminding me that I am above all.

I posses a beautiful green cloak, a simmering green reminding me of fresh moss and emerald waters, which was given to me by my mother and the signet ring of my family, which was a gift from my father. I travel with my hood down so as to show my shoulder-length light blond hair, which shimmers with a faint hue of red in the noon sun. I expertly tie two short braids, one on each side just in front of the ear, woven with a brown leather string and tied at the end with a leather dyed a deep brown, almost black. Beneath the cloak is a simple frock covered with light leather armor. A wear a pair of traveler's boots and am not far from my trusty adventure's pack.

These are my tales!
