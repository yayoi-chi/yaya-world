BabyYayo and Yayoi_chi sit on the beach at Sand Beach. They look out at the sun. Yayoi_chi can already tell that the days are getting shorter, but the pair sit in silence, wearing their kimono hoping to catch a glance of fireworks. Even with the shorter days, it is still far too early. "The days are really getting shorter, huh?" Baby asks, breaking the silence like a distant wave.

Yayoi_chi stretches an arm around her younger sister. She draws her in close, like a mother bird protecting her child. "The are," she says almost dreamily, wondering when Baby will grow too old for this kind of embrace and hoping it isn't too soon. Then a devious smile flashes over Yayoi's lips "You know what that means, right?" she asks.

"No," Baby looks into her sister's eyes trying to figure out what she was thinking all of a sudden.

Yayoi's smile turn to a rather frightening grin. "Its time for you to go back to school!"

"I guess," Baby said, still unsure of her sister's intentions.

Yayoi grabbed her sister's hands forcefully! "Time to get you ready!"

It donned on Baby just what her sister had planned for her, and she wasn't entirely sure she liked it!

* Yayoi's devious plot!

Before Baby was even sure what was happening she was on her feet and heading away from the beach. She looked back longingly "But what about the fireworks," she said quietly. If her sister heard her, she certainly didn't listen, because the pair were soon on their little matching Chirpys and headed back to Roumen.

"School supplies, school supplies," Yayoi breathed as she literally dragged her sister by the hand through the upper road of Roumen, "Who would sell school supplies?" In the distance she spotted Skill Master Ruby. "Surely a skill master would know /something/ about school supplies!" she thought aloud.

Yayoi dragged her sister over to the skill master. "Oh hi there sweeties," the master greeted. She still remember selling skill scrolls to Yayoi_chi back when she was younger, as well as selling some to Baby. "My Baby, you have grown!"

"What about me?" Yayoi_chi asked. For the longest time, it seemed she was stuck in her training, but, recently, she felt she had grown quite a bit as an ADVENTURER.

"You too, darling," Ruby added. Yayoi proudly placed her hands on her hips. "What can I do for you today? Surely you two have both outgrown my little shoppe!"

"I don't know about that," Yayoi said, trying to sound bashful, "but, you're right, we aren't here for skill scrolls. You see its time for Baby here to go back to school!"

Not missing a beat, Ruby replied, "Congrats, dear, but what can /I/ help you with?"

"I know it's probably beneath a merchant of your stature to sell little things like school supplies, but I was wondering if you knew someone who did."

"As a matter of fact I..." Ruby started, "do not, but I hear the blacksmith /might/ at least know where you could get her a uniform. That's a start, no?"

BabyYayo didn't mind being dragged over to Ruby. She had learned a lot thanks to Ruby's skill scrolls and Ruby was always nice to her. She especially liked how Ruby called her "sweetie" or "darling". It really made her feel special somehow, even though she did that with just about everyone, at least as far as Baby was aware. The black smith, however, that was another story. Sure Baby got a lot of her gear from him, but never really liked dealing with him. She hid behind her sister as she asked, "So, I hear you have some information on where every student is getting their uniforms these days."

"And what if I do?" the man asked.

"Well," Yayoi said with a wink and a grin, "I /might/ be able to make it worth your while if you told me."

"Oh, come on now, we all know you're broke," the man said.

"Hey!" Yayoi exclaimed. "I'll have you know I am /not/ broke! I'm just saving a few gems for a rainy day!"

"Have you ever seen a drop of rain here lassy?" the grizzled black smith questioned.

"No, but that doesn't matter, it could rain!"

"Sure..."

"Well, I /can/ make it worth your while, so are you going to tell me where I can get my sister a uniform?"

"Your sister? Oh, is this for the cutey behind you? Why didn't you say so? But I don't exactly know where you can buy her a uniform."

"But..."

"I said I didn't know /exactly/, but I can give you an idea."

"Okay?" Yayoi prompted.

"Two letter, A and R"

"AR, what the hell is that supposed to mean?" Yayoi asked. The blacksmith made a motion like he was a mime zipping is lips closed. "Fine, don't tell me! Come on, Baby, we're leaving!" Baby couldn't say she was sad to go. The man was still giving her a creepy look.

* Yayoi's surprise!

"Abestol Ruins," Baby suddenly called out as Yayoi dragged her toward the teleport gate in Roumen.

"What?" Yayoi asked.

"A and R," Baby explained, "A is Abestol and R is Ruins!"

"What a smart sister I have!" Yayoi_chi exclaimed. She set their destination for Abestol Ruins and soon they were in the small village. "But don't think this means you get to skip school!" the girl added. Baby sighed, it seemed that even her adventuring wouldn't save her from school. Of course, she knew all to well just how stubborn her sister could be.

After asking around for a bit, the pair finally found where to pick up a uniform and school supplies. Baby was feeling very encumbered as she carried all of the new supplies in the few bags she had. As she tried to juggle have everything, her sister took her by the shoulder. "I have a surprise," she said with a wink. /What now?/ Baby wondered.

Yayoi_chi stopped by the storage keeper. She let go of her sister's hands. "Wait here," she said with another wink. Baby let out a sigh and watched as her sister chatted with the storage keeper for a few minutes. Fortunately, she was gone too long. "All set," the older sister said, "let's get you into your uniform."

"What!?" BabyYayo complained, "Now!?" Yayoi nodded while she pushed her sister off into one of the nearby buildings. She found a quiet room and handed her younger sister the uniform they just purchased.
* Did you think I'd make you go alone?

BabyYayo put on the uniform and stepped out of the private room her sister had found. She expected to see her sister, but Yayoi_chi was no where to be seen. "Did she leave me here?" the girl asked. She plopped herself on a nearby bench, only to stand right back up at the slightest sound of a door opening. It was her sister and she was also wearing a school uniform. "Oneechan!" Baby called.

"I never said you'd be going to school alone," Yayoi_chi stated.

"Oneechan," Baby said with a smile.

"Now we can be partners in school ADVENTURES!" Yayoi_chi proclaimed.

"Onee~~chan!!" Baby shouted!
