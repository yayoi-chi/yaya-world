#+SUMMARY:

After following [[{{% ref lvling %}}][my guide]] thus far
you'll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really
hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods
and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully,
you've gotten yourself into a good guild /and/ have managed to collect a
lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are
still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through
so onward to ADVENTURE.

   :END:
Okay, okay, all of the reps from here on, well from 116 on really, have
a looooooooot of prequests, but they are pretty much essential for
leveling now, so there isn't much you can do about it, sadly. Just
hunker down, grab some friends, and grind, grind, grind.

*** Levels 121-123
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: levels-121-123
    :END:
Do the Beaks and Shellas repeat (if you can't tell there are too many
different types of Shellas in this game 😆). To get this repeat complete
these quests in this order. "Embarrassed Basilone">"Basilone is avoiding
to answer">"Bailone's Colleagues">"Collecting the Colleagues Belongings
1">"Collecting the Colleagues belongings 2">"Collecting the Colleagues
Belongings 3">"Present for Jey">"Jey's Colleague">"Basilone's
Lie">"Suspicious Basilone". That is seriously a lot 😵‍💫, but it will
unlock "Continues Suspicion", a fairly good rep, and give you quite a
lot of exp to boot, so it isn't all bad.

*** Levels 124-125
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: levels-124-125
    :END:
There are actually quite a few reps here, including one that a lot of
people will probably tell you about where you just go and gather a
special type of wood. This rep is slow, very slow, without droppers and
the rest of the reps are also pretty slow, so you can look em up in the
[[http://fiesta-wiki.com/quests/12][Fiesta Wiki]] if you'd like, but I prefer to just run around and
quest here. There are lots of quests you have saved to this point and
they should be more than enough to get you to 125. Also, there is the
Bajou Sancturary KQ, so that can help.

*** Levels 125-126
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: levels-125-126
    :END:
Again, the rep here is slow, so quest and do BS KQ. If you don't quite
make it to 126, or you're tired of running around complete these
prequests: "Ancient Scriptures (1-5)>"Oh Captain, My Captain!
(1-7)">"The Arrival”>"Lending A Hand">"Nighttime disturbance". After
that, you'll gain two reps "Their Health Is In Danger" and "Nighttime
disurbance". In the right spot, both reps can be done together.

*** Levels 127-128
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: levels-127-128
    :END:
Mushies rep. This rep takes 6-8 hours with a full party of droppers (be
nice and save the quest so you can be a dropper for others). To get this
rep you only need to complete the "Mushrooms for Ursula" prequest. *Note
(because no one told me this)*: You will need one basket from the item
merchant in Isle of Eya for the prequest and then a /second/ one for the
rep. Just make sure to keep the basket in your inventory until your
done.

*** Levels 128-130
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: levels-128-130
    :END:
The second wood rep. This is much faster than mushies, but is still
better with a full party of droppers. Just look for "Serben and His
Woods". The first will be a non-repeatable, turn it back into to Serben
to get the repeatable version.

*** Levels 130-135
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: levels-130-135
    :END:
From this point until cap, you will want to make sure you complete your
[[{{% ref dailies.org %}}][daily quests]] and compete in available KQs.
Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 game time. You have some rep
options to help fill your time.

1. Level 130-131 - "Success is everything" or "Helping Yuna 1"
2. Level 130-132 - "Front Lines"
3. Level 132-134 - "The Predator Leader" or "Helping Yuna 2"
4. Level 134-135 - "The Final Ingredient" or "Helping Yuna 3"

/Final Note/: The 135 reps are very slow. Focus on your dailies and KQS
and complete any quests you haven't done those far (aside from those
your dropping for) to help move things a bit faster.
