#+SUMMARY:

Before we begin, it is important to understand that everything in Fiesta
is divided into tiers, this includes weapons, armor, and jewlery. Since
Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons,
armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2
bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5
shield will need tier 5 stones. For your reference:

- Tier 1 refers to level 1~20 items
- Tier 2 refers to level 20~50
- Tier 3 to 51~80
- Tier 4 to 81-99
- Tier 5 to 100+
- Tier 6 is rserved for lgendary weapons.

** Enhacement Breakage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: enhacement-breakage
   :END:
When enhancing and item, there is a possibility it will break. However,
some items seem to have a kind of safe zone in which they won't break
until a certain point. There is still a chance of downgrading, but that
doesn't cause you to lose the item like breaking. Here are the safe
zones:

Generally best to follow the rule of safe until +3, but here are the
more specific safe zones:

- Tier 1 never break up to +5
- Tier 2 and Tier 3 don't break until +4
- Tier 4 and Tier 5 don't break until +3

** Maximum Enhancement

   :CUSTOM_ID: maximum-enhancement
   :END:
Just how high can you enhance items? Depends on the type

- Accessories: Tier 1-5 can be enhanced to +9
- Armor: Tier 1-5 can be enhanced to +10
- Shields: Tier 1-5 can also go to +10
- Weapons: Tiers 1&2 can only go to +10 while 3-5 can go upto +12

/Note/: You will need a special stone called "Karis" to go past +9

** Stones
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: stones
   :END:
These are the types of stones you need. The tier of the stone needs to
be equal to the tier of the item, as mentioned above.

Tier 1-5 enhacement stones for weapons, gears, and accessories

- Elrue: +1, +2, and +3
- Lix: +4, +5, and +6
- Xir: +7, +8 and +9
- Karis: +10, +11, and +12

These stones come in tree colors:

- Green are normal, they have no special effects and will increase by +1
- Purple are Blessed, they have a higher chance of upgrading by +1 and
  even a very small chance of upgrading +2
- Blue are lucky their chance of upgrade is lower than blessed, but it
  has a higher chance to upgrade by +2

As a general rule */NEVER/* use a lucky elrue when your enhancing a +2
weapon or gear at tier 4 or 5! According to users of the forums: "The
chance of breakage is low, but it CAN HAPPEN, and it happened with a lot
of us."

As Tier 6 weapons are special they use a special enhacement stone called
"Crystal of bijou" for all of their stages (+1 ~ +12)

Bracelets also use a special 'stone' for enhancing. I haven't had much
experience with bracelets, but I'll list what I know:

Tier 1-4 bracelets use fragements of bijou

- Tier 1: +1 - +5
- Tier 2: +1 - +10
- Tier 3: +1 - +15
- Tier 4: +1 - +20

This fragments are also colored:

- Light blue are brilliant and will NOT break and item, but they have
  chance to downgrade and fail
- Pink are radiant and will not break or downgrade, but can still fail
- Rainbow are splendid and do not break or downgrade and has a 30%
  success rate

/Note/ radiant and splendid are cash store items.

** SC Enhacement Stones
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sc-enhacement-stones
   :END:
These are often purchased in bundles (as this is much more affordable)
so people use call these bundles. You'll probably want all three types
at once anyway, so might as well bundle 'em 😉

- Perfect red eye: Decreases breakage rate by 100%
- Perfect blue mile: Decreases chance of downgrade by 100%
- Gold nine: Increases chance of enhacement success by 15-25%

You should really save the red eyes for when items actually have a
chance of breaking, see "Enhancement Breakage" above.

** Extra Tips (Free of Charge 😉)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: extra-tips-free-of-charge
   :END:

1. Try to avoid places that are highly populated or use shift+z to hide
   players
2. Try to use blessed elrue for items above +2
3. Use normal for 0 to +2
