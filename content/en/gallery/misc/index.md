Oh boi! I'm not really sure what to do with this one. The original plan was to have screenshots of the ADVENTURES I've had in past games, but, with clips on Twitch and my [YouTube Archives](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFe_D6-Ml99oIIwXaAMrMayxFG7lDdSE) I'm not really sure any more. I haven't updated it in **ages** 😅 Right now its just a random set of screenshots from one MMO I used to play. Maybe it'll showcase ADVENTURES I have with kittens? I don't know yet, thanks for looking though 😅
