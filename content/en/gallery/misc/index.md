This is my Wall o' ADVENTURE! Currently its a bunch of random screenshots from [Fiesta Online](http://fiesta.gamingo.com). In the future I plan on putting other screenshots from other games that don't fit with a particular theme or story here. I think I'll have more specific galleries for screenshots and peektures that have some kind of theme, but these are all I have at the moment.
