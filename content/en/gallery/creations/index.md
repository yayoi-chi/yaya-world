I draw too! That's right I don't just play games, but I also like to draw. I will even stream my art, you can check out my past art streams on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFe_D6-Ml98xWkSINAfE8FWSVrdK2iIg). I try to do at least one art stream a week, so please check it out, and check out my finished works below!
