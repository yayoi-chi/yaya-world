This is a collection of some of my favorite wallpapers. I like vector art and I like wallpapers that aren't too busy. If you like those things too, then maybe you should download *some* of these...or not...up to you 😜.

I do **not** own *any* of these wallpapers. If I have information on who created it, that information is in the caption! Also for basically all of autumn last year I rocked a very dark theme on all of my devices. This was the [Dracrula Theme](https://draculatheme.com) it was a really cool theme and the macOS wallpaper (there are other versions, check out the site!) for it is included below!
