#+SUMMARY: Collab with @Bsparkx went super well! I always end up spending a lot of resin when I play with her, but it is because we have so much fun poking things! I also completed the giant robot in Xenosaga! We're almost ready for the end. Still trudging along on page 4 of the comic too! Almost done there as well.

* Art Streams
Page four is coming along! We finished the third panel and moved on to the fourth. Hopefully they turn out pretty good. I'm also hopeful that the fifth panel is pretty quick. I don't want to rush these pages, but having so many raw recorded parts is eating a bit of space on my drive. It will be nice to finish so I can free up that space. At least I got rid of the duplicates....don't ask me why it records twice ðŸ˜…
* Game Streams
Four game week again! We have lots of waiting ahead of us in Persona 3 Reload. I managed to take the wait down a bit, but still some waiting left. We had an awesome collab in Genshin Impact. We assembled Erde Kaiser in Xenosaga. Finally, we started a new game! Sonic Generations.
** Persona 3 Reload
Waiting...waiting...more waiting. The stream wasn't too boring though because there were lots of Social Link stories to do and a few rescue missions took us back into Tatarus. We managed to shave quite a few days off the waiting time too! Let's see if we can get to the Promised Day next time!

** Genshin Impact
Mayhap spent quiet a lot of resin, but I had so much fun poking bosses and domains with the awesome [[https://www.twitch.tv/bsparkx][@Bsparkx]]. It is always fun doing co-op things with her. I think we're quite a good team and I hope I managed to help her as much as she helped me.

** Xenosaga Episode 1
Thanks to digging out (and dusting off) my old strategy guide, I quickly found the last doors and keys we needed to get our robot parts. We went through the side story and had the Professor assemble everything for us. Armed with the invincible Erde Kaiser we will make quick work of the final boss! Who's excited for Episode 2?

** Sonic Generations
New game, who 'dis!? Kidding! I had played Sonic Generations a long while ago, but this is the first time playing it for the kittens. I know I have to go fast so chatting is difficult. I hope you at least have fun watching though. I'll be coming back to it again!

* Next Week
 [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] gets the backseat again! I'm going to experiment with live streaming Genshin Impact on my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] just to see if I can make numbers make sense ðŸ˜† Other than that, pretty standard week.
