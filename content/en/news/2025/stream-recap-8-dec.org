#+SUMMARY: I had intended on having a nice, normal week of streams this week, but that just didn't seem to be in the cards. I did keep my appointment at the PEAK with Bsparkx and manage to also keep up both Throwback Thursday and VN Nite. That was all, sadly. Hopefully next week will be better.

* Art Streams
Without going into too much detail that I already covered in a separate [[{{% ref 'news/2025/a-ittle-tumble.org' %}}][letter to my kittens]] I'll just say on this day last week I had a tumble and I was not able to do any work on my project or host a Maker Monday stream. I think there is still time so let's try our best to get the project done before Christmas!
* Game Streams
Because of my tumble I couldn't stream on Tuesday either. I wasn't even sure about streaming with Bsparkx on Wednesday at first, but I was able to manage a short, but fun stream with her. All the other streams were also a bit short, but we managed to head back to the moon in Dark Cloud and get a par-tay planned in Danganronpa 2!
** PEAK
I had a lot of fun climbing the PEAK with my friend. She may have had to carry me to the top once after a fall, but she got me there and I was revived. We both later died, but that's okay the PEAK isn't important, it's the nonsense we make along the way!

** Dark Cloud
After many a chat and a lot of fun we managed to get through the craters of the moon sea. I think I remember now that we were making a Sun Giant, which I think is indeed a mech of some kind. I believe we have all the parts, but, as I am still recovering, I ended stream a bit early to rest. Next week, I'll be back and we'll take care of this!

** Danganronpa 2
So far no one has been keeled. We're still trying to find a way to work together though some of us seem to be more willingly than others. Also, I guess we're having a party. Seems like a bad time, but, then again maybe it's a good time for a party. Not sure about it going all night though. I certainly couldn't handle that.

* Next Week
[[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] and the [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] will Hopefully at least have a normal amount of streams. I'm still being a little cautious with my head so am leaving out Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves this week. Depending on how I do they may be back next week though!
