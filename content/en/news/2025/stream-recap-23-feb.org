#+SUMMARY: The experiment...didn't help. I think maybe I just don't have enough data points. We did finish quite a few things this week though! Xenosaga Episode 1, Sonic Generations, and the fourth comic page üéâ Overall, not a bad week. Just need to figure out how to handle Genshin Impact...

* Art Streams
Okay, so I /did/ finish the fourth page of the comic this week, but... there are *five* recordings to go through, timelapse, and edit üòµ‚Äçüí´ I'll try to put the embed for the timelapse as soon as I finish, for now, just trust that it /is/ done. I'm not sure if I'm going to start the next page next week or maybe do something else. Even if I do something else though, I'm not sure what yet. In other words, next week's art stream is a bit up in the air, but, we have four /completed/ comic pages üéâ
* Game Streams
Aside from completing that page, we managed to finish not one but two games. Okay one was short, but its complete nonetheless. The other, is also just the first game in a series, but also, complete, so that three total things done. Maybe this wee we finish Persona 3 Reload? We'll see!
** Persona 3 Reload
Didn't quite make it to the Promised Day yet. Almost there, make next stream. I feel like we've accomplishe a lot. Maybe its because I didn't make it quite this far in P3 before, or I didn't do as well with Persona 5 or something, but I have a lot of social links maxed and all but one social stat (dumb Academics üò†). I think it has been a good run though. Let's see if we can get to that final fight next week!

** Genshin Impact
Lantern Rite really was fun, but its time to go back to our dendro archon quests! Which we did, and now Nahida seems even more trapped and we're just wondering around a desert! Will we get to free Nahida, or will she just be trapped forever? Also, does Sumeru have their Katheryne back? I guess we'll answer those questions next time when we play Genshin again üòÜ

** Xenosaga Episode 1
We finished it! Yep, Erde Kaiser came through! Not only did the giant robot help with that final fight, but also took Albedo out in one shot, meaning we were basically at the same strength as when we started that fight. Sadly, I did miscalculate and Shion was knocked out in her AWGS, but that didn't stop us from winning! I even started Episode 2! Look forward to this section being titled "Xenosaga Episode 2" next week!

** Sonic Generations
Sonic Generations proved to be a good distraction after Hollow Knight. I don't plan on going back to Hollow Knight for awhile, but maybe I'll do the true ending /some time/. We did finish this though, but we'll keep up with some cute games for a bit!

* Next Week
 [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] gets the backseat once more! I'm going to experiment with live streaming Genshin Impact on my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] again, numbers still aren't making sense, but maybe a different time would help?
