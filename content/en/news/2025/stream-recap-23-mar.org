#+SUMMARY: New week, new collab! Tried to get it so everyone could hear my collab partner (Bsparkx), but was still good. Also started Persona 5. I was reminded how much I like that game and am very excited to share it with the Kittens!

* Art Streams
Did another panel and a half of my comic. Wish I had more to talk about, but you'll see it when its all done. I know I keep saying it, but I think it is really turning out good. For my first ever comic, I think I'm doing fairly well. Hopefully I will also learn a lot and make even better ones in the future.
* Game Streams
Fun collabs are fun! I /had/ planned on doing a new game with Bsparkx, but I didn't do research so we changed it kinda last minute. I always have fun though, so it was okay. Maybe new game next week. Started Persona 5 Royal as well and I was reminded how much I love that game! Made progress in Xenosaga and Kirby as well, but no 100% yet. Maybe some other time. Another new game next week!
** Persona 5 Royal
I love this game! Have I said I love this game? We're just getting started too, but I reminded of when I first played it on PS4. I have a steelbook edition and I think that restarted my love of Persona. In fact, I don't think I would have gone back to Persona 3 (let alone bought Reload) if it wasn't for this game. I look forward to sharing more of it with my kittens!

** Xenosaga Episode 2
We just dove straight into MOMO's brain, but things do kind of get complicated when people do that in Xenosaga. She's around, but I guess we get to see how Junior fell for Sakura, or something. Oh! Junior visited a beach for the first time, but it wasn't all that fun ðŸ˜œ

** Genshin Impact
We had lots of fun poking things again! We mostly poked the same domain over-and-over, but I think we got most of a set for Bsparkx's Sucrose. Above all we had fun. Was it as much fun as Lego Star Wars, we won't know, but it was still lots of fun!

** Kirby Star Allies
I knew I was finally close to the end so I thought about setting a goal to 100% it. I didn't manage that though. I think you have to explore all the modes and stuff, which I did manage to do some of, but 100% is a long ways away still. We have other games to explore, but mayhap we try to 100% this again sometime!

* Next Week
[[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] and the [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] will both have a very similar schedule as they did this week. There will be another collab on Friday, but we'll either be exploring Wutheing Waves or Zenless Zone Zero together just for a change. We'll also continue the art stream, Throwback Thursday, and Persona 5 Royal! Hope every kitten has as much fun as I do!
