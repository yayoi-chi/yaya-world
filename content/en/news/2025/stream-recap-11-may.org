#+SUMMARY: Another shorter week, but a lot happened. We found the next treasure in Persona 5 Royal (though our route isn't secure yet). We got through Labyrinthos in Xenosaga Episode II. We even managed not only a few main story quests in Wuthering Waves, but also a couple event quests! Busy busy week!

* Art Streams
We're still making progress. I finished the second panel and started the third. I'm hoping the third panel won't be as complex as the second and that maybe we can also finish the fourth panel or at least get it very close to finished next!
* Game Streams
We found the next treasure in Persona 5 Royal (though our route isn't secure yet). We got through Labyrinthos in Xenosaga Episode II. We even managed not only a few main story quests in Wuthering Waves, but also a couple event quests! I think it was a good week for game streams!
** Persona 5 Royal
We managed to recruit a fox! Our numbers are really growing. We also found the treasure, but haven't yet secured a good route to it. I think we're doing a good job pacing ourselves though. Maybe we'll do some Momentoes stuff to level up for next time!

** Xenosaga Episode II
We got to the Zohar and had yet another rematch with Margulus. Heart string were pulled once we found Cecily and Cathe and had to end their suffering. I'm sure you know what that means. We stopped right after that scene, which involved the destruction of miltia as well. More game left for next week! Xenosaga III, when? Soon, methinks!

** Wuthering Waves
We did lots of stuff this stream! We rolled some dice. Helped Encore and ended up meeting Abbowser. We even watched Shorekeeper descend into a black hole. I think it was a very productive and fun stream!

* Next Week
We're shaking things up on both [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] and the [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] please pay attention to the times! I'm trying some different times for streams to see if I can get them to work a little better with my school and work schedules. Also, we're back with a collab with Bsparkx! I'm so excited!
