#+SUMMARY: I did a practice thing! You won't find this practice thing here, or anywhere, you had to be there live! I did it though. You know something you can see though? I started a new comic page! Also I got myself stuck in Genshin 😅

* Art Streams
There were two art streams this week, one of them is completely unarchived! That one was just a bit of practice. What did I practice? I'm not going to tell you! The other one was also not archived, but was recorded and I will be putting it into a timelapse. I do that with many of art my streams as they are done in multiple parts. This was the first part of my fourth comic page. More parts to come!
* Game Streams
There were three game streams too! We started the new year in Persona 3 Reload and are getting close to the end in Xenosaga Episode 1 as well. I did kind of get myself a little stuck in Genshin though as I had to stop in the middle of a fun part of the dendro archon quest because of work, stoopit work 😠
** Persona 3 Reload
It took us some time, but we finally made it to the new year! I made my decision and we are heading toward the top of Tartarus! I don't know what lies at the top, but we're going to face it. I don't care if they tell us we can't win, we're going to try!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
We continued exploring Proto Merkabah! MOMO has done extremely well. We're getting close to the end, but I still have doors to find! Let's hope I find them before the final boss so it can be easy peasie!

** Genshin Impact
I am now trapped in Sumeru City. The dendro archon questline is far more interesting than I expected and I really didn't expect to meet Nahida this way, but meet her we did! Hopefully, we'll be able to break free of this dream soon!

* Next Week
[[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] is back in the front seat for another week! There will be three streams there and only two on my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]]! Instead of two art streams there will be two Genshin streams though! I have to get myself out of Sumeru City somehow!
