#+SUMMARY: I revealed a new outfit! That's pretty much the most exciting thing about this week. I mean sure, it was the first week of 2025, but that's not all that exciting, no? I mean we did play Xenosaga and we did beat Exdeath and finish Final Fantasy V, but that wasn't that exciting either, right? A new outfit though...

* Art Streams
Finished the second panel for our third page of the comic! We're making progress. I can't wait for this all to come together for everyone. I'm hoping it will be a good introduction to me and help you see my story. I'm going to have to pace myself though so I don't burn out. That said, I think the next two panels will be pretty easy and will flow together so I /might/ finish this page next week...we'll see...
* Game Streams
Didn't make a lot of progress in Xenosaga, but we did do some archon quest shtuff in Genshin and...I BEAT EXDEATH!! Yep we'll be taking a break for Final Fantasy for a bit, because I finally finished V.
** Xenosaga Episode 1
I found one robot part, just one. All that searching and we only found an arm. I think we can at least do the side story chapter with the two arms, but I'm going to need to find more keys and doors! We'll get there though. I will make sure the last fight is quick and easy!

** Genshin Impact
We did a lot of stuff, but most of it was related to dailies. That said, we did also continue the dendro archon quests. I learned some sad stuff too. Hopefully things will be nicer for our poor archon soon. It does make me appreciate and love her even more though!

** Final Fantasy V
I'll say it again here! I BEAT EXDEATH!!! It made for a somewhat short stream, but we finished Final Fantasy V. I'm so excited. I started with three a long while ago, but now five is finally done. I'm going to take a break from Final Fantasy for a little bit though. Seems we'll be back to Hollow Knight and, of course, I still need to finish Persona 3 Reload, but FFV is complete! Thank you for watching my journey kittens!

* Next Week
[[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] is taking a bit of a back seat compared to my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] this week. I'm doing two art streams both on YouTube and one game stream also there. Xenosaga and Genshin will be on Twitch though! I swear I'm not leaving!
