#+SUMMARY: A pretty normal week. Hope every kitten is getting used to the new routine. We had a great art stream working on new panels for page six of my comic. We also found a new target in Persona 5 Royal and made it to Laborythos in Xenosaga Episode II. My favorite though was probably our Genshin stream where I got to trail Nahida.

* Art Streams
We finished the panel we started last week and moved on to a new panel this week. I had fun drawing a flooded library and my catself trying to get out of that mess. We'll be moving on to another room ruined by irrate magic next week then there will be a couple easy panels and the page will be done!
* Game Streams
 We found a new target in Persona 5 Royal and made it to Laborythos in Xenosaga Episode II. My favorite though was probably our Genshin stream where I got to trail Nahida. Of course trailing Nahida was a highlight but this part of her archon quest was also so sad and yet so heartwarming. Extra love for Nahida ðŸ’œ
** Persona 5 Royal
We finally had enough small fries! We got ourselves a meal! Well, that is to say, we found a good target and a new palace. This one isn't going to be easy. I'm also pacing myself more in the palace so streams are more interesting. Meant some more social link time! Let's see if we can do Mementos and a Palace next time!

** Genshin Impact
We did it! We fought the "fake god" and we won! Also we got to trail Nahida! It was soo nice, but boy this story is sad. Nahida is such a good archon and she needs more love!
