** Persona 5 Royal
We finally had enough small fries! We got ourselves a meal! Well, that is to say, we found a good target and a new palace. This one isn't going to be easy. I'm also pacing myself more in the palace so streams are more interesting. Meant some more social link time! Let's see if we can do Mementos and a Palace next time!

** Genshin Impact
We did it! We fought the "fake god" and we won! Also we got trail Nahida! It was soo nice, but boy this story is sad. Nahida is such a good archon and she needs more love!
