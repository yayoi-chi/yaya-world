#+SUMMARY: I had my first collabrative stream ever! It was a lot of fun! I hope for more of these in the future, especially with the awesome Bsparkx! In other news, there was also two art streams, and there probably will be for near future!

* Art Streams
Two, not one, but two art streams this week! You will not find an embed for either of them though. I was doing individual timelapses for each stream mostly so I could have something to showcase each week. I decided that I wanted to change that though. I'd rather show the entire project from start-to-finish, so you may not see videos here each week, but I'm hoping what you do see will be amazing!

This weeks streams focused on finishing up the panel I started last time. I still have to finish Ya-ma, which I will do next week before moving on to the second and third panels. Hopefully I get a good pace going here, but I have my annual Christmas picture to do so some of the streams will be focused on that. Also, we may need three a week, but don't worry I've always wanted to be more of an art streamer üòù
* Game Streams
Having two art streams this week did mean that I had to cut a game stream. I decided to cut Final Fantasy this week. I'll probably alternate Persona 3 Reload and Final Fantasy V until I either finish one or the end of the year!
** Persona 3 Reload
A big spoiler filled with spoilers! I beat a shadow, the twelfth big one. That's all you need to know. Of course, you'll see below that the video is 2:27:25 long! That shadow didn't take that long to beat, so what happened in the rest of the video? Guess you'll have to watch to find out üòâ

** Xenosaga Episode 1
Made it back from the past! Then they played "that song" and things went wonky...very wonky. I started helping with the evacuation but than tried to face a special boss that I was pretty sure I wasn't really ready for. Haven't finished that evacuation yet üòÖ

** Genshin Impact
Me and [[https://www.youtube.com/@Bsparkx][Bsparkx]] hunted beeg baddies together and poked a couple domains. I mean there was a lot of poking and a lot of fun ü§©. We'll be collaborating again sometime! Don't forget to also check out [[https://youtu.be/_rYaYLmy7xY?si=6fkuW4cafD-FtzTq][her perspective]]!

* Next Week
 Because of Thanksgiving in the US, I am losing a day of streaming! So, there will be two streams on [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]], and two on my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]]. This also means that Throwback Thursday will be moved to Saturday, because that's my decree!
