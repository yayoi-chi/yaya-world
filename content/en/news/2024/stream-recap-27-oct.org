#+SUMMARY: Sick week of sickness was not fun, not fun at all. Two of my streams were canceled this week due to illness. Still, I did manage to finish the rat game, and two canceled means three went up, so that's good, right?

* Art Stream
Unfortunately, this stream, as well as one of the game streams, was canceled this week. I woke up feeling pretty bad on Monday and decided I needed some extra rest. Setting up for a stream just didn't seem like a good idea. I did rest and managed to get a bit better pretty quickly, but, that didn't last the whole week, sadly ðŸ˜¢
* Game Streams
Went from bad to good to not good pretty quickly this week. My two YouTube streams went off without any problems, but I ended up canceling again on Throwback Thursday. Still we made good progress in Prey, survived Corpse Party, and finish A Plague Tale, so yay!
** Corpse Party
Full disclosure, I had played these games before. I don't feel very prepared for them mentally or emotionally any more. I think I was in a different head space back then. Either way, I think we're making good progress. Didn't finish chapter 3, but I think we'll get there soon!

** Prey
I learned more cheats and abilities and even hacks in this game now! Still wasn't able to free the elevator though, but I did beat a telepath and that's no joke! Still, its a lot harder to blow this place than I thought ðŸ˜†

** A Plague Tale: Innocence
We did it! We beat the rat game ðŸ¥³ I no longer have an unhealthy fear of rats (just a healthy one). Actually rats are kind of cool now!
