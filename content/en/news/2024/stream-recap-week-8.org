#+SUMMARY: I've been streaming for two months and haven't technically had a full debut o:! I do plan on fixing that...just don't know when. I just worked on finishing my BRB card this week and played some Hollow Knight...I mean LOTS of Hollow Knight 😆

* Art Stream
It took *two* streams, but I did finally finish my BRB card. The video below shows the whole process. I did make three parts originally, but, by the third part I decided to just combine them as one especially considering that two of the three parts happened in the same week.

* Game Streams
Many a Hollow Knight strim o:! Just trying to get things done. Turns out, this is a good thing considering what I'm planning for the next three weeks. Let's just say, chu won't see much of Hollow Knight until after July 😅
** Super Mario Bros. 3
Just kind of wanted a break from Chrono Trigger, so I picked up a game that has a lot of nostalgia for me. I played the NES version for Nintendo Online on the Switch.

** Hollow Knight
In the first Hollow Knight Stream I got to Deepnest, but it was getting suuuper creepy so I stopped for a bit

In the second stream I made my way out of Deepnest and back to the Ancient Basin for another encounter with Hornet. She's much harder now, and I was making a lot of dum mistakes so I stopped there. Will be a bit before I fight her again. Look at my schedule next week 😅
