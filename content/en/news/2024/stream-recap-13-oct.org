#+SUMMARY: Not only did I create a few fairy wings and a head pat emote this week, but this was also the official debut of ghost cat! What are her intentions with my stream? Who even is she? I guess we'll have to wait and fight out!

* Art Stream
This week I wanted to start celebrating my move to Twitch affiliate by making emotes. I may have spent too much time on fairy wings for my sub badge. I did manage one and it's probably the best one! Head pats for all!

* Game Streams
This weeks ghost cat took over all of my streams! I don't know what her deal is, but hopefully my viewers will be safe! We played Prey, Fatal Frame II, and A Plague Tale again.
** Prey
I got a lot of scares in this week, or rather I got scared a lot this time! I did manage to gain mimic powers. So now I can scare the living daylights out of other now, maybe! Didn't seem to work so well yet, but maybe later! Anyway, got stuck by a phantom, but we'll take care that next time!

** Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly
We are still trying to locate sister. I may have spent too much time not quite understanding what I was supposed to do. I think I got it in the end though! Yes, dark came is still dark ðŸ˜… Also, the flashlight doesn't seem to work anymore...

** A Plague Tale: Innocence
We went to university and got a book! We didn't check it out though, and there may have been a little fire, but...uhm...its fine...I'm sure everything is fine ðŸ˜… Also, still rats!

* Next Week
 Next week the streams will be mostly on [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] again, with two on my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]]! Homework days are still here, but it seems two might have been a bit excessive, so we'll try just one this week and hopefully I'll still get everything done!
