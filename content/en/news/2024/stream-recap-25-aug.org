#+SUMMARY: Another two art streams in one week, but only one stream per day. The week was definitely not as hectic as the last week. We went back to Hollow Knight and Xenosaga, but started the next the Final Fantasy game!

* Art Stream
Keeping up with my desire to do more art streams and draw cats, of course. I did two art stream again this week. I didn't do any on the same day as a game stream this time. I kept the two separate, but still had lots of fun drawing kitties with my kittens commenting and chatting as I drew.
** Streeetching Kitty
For this week I started by finishing the project I started in the last art stream last week. So now we have an adorable cat stretching on her favorite bed.

** Kitty TV
While finishing the streeetching kitty, I started another kitty. This one is staring out a window. I call it Kitty TV, because a window can always be a TV for a cat.

* Game Streams
Even though I started doing more art streams, I'm not going to stop doing game streams. I started with Hollow Knight, because I'm addicted. I also had to keep going on Xenosaga, and, of course, it was time to start Final Fantasy V!
** Hollow Knight
For this stream, I was just exploring, but I did remember why I had to beat Hornet and, after figuring that out I got a new ability that really started to open up Hollownest. Because of my meeting, I didn't get to see much of the new stuff, but I'll get there next time!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
I finished rescuing MOMO, but we had a lot of cutscenes to go through again, so it was a lot of popcorn time and not too much game play. Still I love this game and I hope my kittens love it to!

** Final Fantasy V
Just got started on this one. I beat IV so it was time add I and we all know that IV + I is V. I just got started, managed to get two sets of jobs, but I think I still have a long way to go!
