#+SUMMARY: It was finally time for a new card for OBS. After turning off my model too many times so I can take a break, I decided, I needed a BRB card üòù I also went back to Hello Kitty Island Adventure and Persona!

* Art Stream
After turning off my vTuber model a few too many times during streams so I can drink water or take a break, I decided it was about time for a BRB card so you can still see who's streaming, and I still don't have to worry about my model losing tracking! Check out the first part below! No I didn't finish üòÖ

* Game Streams
** Chrono Trigger
This stream had a lot more back and forth through time. We left 6.5 million BC and went on to 1000AD, but spent more time in the medieval ages working to defeat Magus.

** Hello Kitty Island Adventure
I barely even talked with my Oshi, even though she was in the title ü•∫ Mostly wondering around. I opened up the nature preserve and the haunted house and finally found my way up to Gemstone Town!

** Hollow Knight
Lots of wondering around trying to find paths I still have access too. I did meet a new bug and got a new nail art. I also managed to find the Spirit Glade and my wondering through Fungal Wastes may have opened a potential direction for next stream!
