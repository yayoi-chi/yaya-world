#+SUMMARY: Two art streams are going the norm for awhile, methinks. Also, due to Thanksgiving in the US, I only had two game streams. Two and two!

* Art Streams
Final two streams putting together the second page of my comic! I'm not a professional comic artist, but I do like how this turned out! Since I finished it this week you can watch the whole thing below!

* Game Streams
Thanksgiving week so I moved Throwback Thursday to Saturday, but still lost a day of streaming. Only two game streams this week, but still a fun week!
** Final Fantasy V
Alternating Final Fantasy V and Persona 3 Reload until I finish one or I re-evaluate my life choices XD Made a bit more progress, but now I feel very under leveled. Even if I don't stream it this next week, I'll probably try to grind a bit off stream. Still I think I'm close to the end, so there's that!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
Hey! I'm getting close to the end of this one too! Moving it to Saturday this week meant I had a bit more time so we finished the evacuation, watched all those cutscenes and got started on "The Song". I did forget how crazy Albedo really was...I think he mellows a bit in 2, but we'll see!

 Back to normal stream operations! So, there will be three streams on [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] (including another collab with the awesome Bsparkx!), and two on my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]]. Also means that Throwback Thursday is now back to actually being on Thursday 😝
