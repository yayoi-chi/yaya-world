#+SUMMARY: I needed two art streams to do one project this week! Well, maybe only one and half, but I made it two. I also streamed a bit more on YouTube this week, and I messed around with on screen chat there. Next week will be more on Twitch, cuz I'm affiliate!

* Art Stream
Spooky Month outfit time! This is the full outfit that I plan to rig for live animation and use later in Spooky Month. There was one stream on Twitch and one stream on YouTube. I combined them into one video on YouTube though for easy watching!

* Game Streams
Went back to Hollow Knight and Persona this week. I also streamed more on YouTube. I actually prefer it, and I don't know why, but I'm still not leaving Twitch any time soon!
** Hollow Knight
After a break from Hollow Knight, I went back and finally beat those roly-poly knights! After that I got the third dreamer and spent some time trying to see if anything new had opened up. I fought I really angry guardian, but I gottem! You know wut I got for it? I dum mask? No just the fragment of one!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
Made it to the foundation and watched a *lot* more scenes. Things do pick up later, but this episode is very story-centered. I still like it though. Hopefully it isn't to boring for everyone 😅

** Final Fantasy V
Made some more progress in the second world, but still just getting started. A group of enemies really started to kick my butt near the end. I'm going to grind and come back though!

** Persona 3 Reload
A mixture of story, Tartarus exploration and working on Social Links. Overall, a typical playthrough of a Persona game. This game has a lot of feels though! I'm getting surprised!
