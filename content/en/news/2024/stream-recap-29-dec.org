#+SUMMARY: We did some art and we did a bit of gaming. The week was sort because of the holidays. Also a lot of personal thing happened and, well, Portal 2 somehow turned into Genshin here! Still managed to have fun though!

* Art Streams
This week we finished the first panel for the third page of our motion comic! Not really much to talk about there, but I also finally finished editing the timelapse for this year's Christmas picture. I probably should've went ahead and started it sooner, but here it is!

* Game Streams
Because of the holidays, the week was a little shorter, also, if you jump down below, you'll see next week will also be shorter, but we still managed a few streams. Just uhm...don't look at last week's schedule...if you did, well Portal 2 became Genshin Impact, it happens.
** Xenosaga Episode 1
I decided it was time to start opening some of those red doors. In hindsight, I probably should have waited. A lot of the doors and keys are probably in the last dungeon. Still it was a nice chill stream seeing how stronk my party has become!

** Persona 3 Reload
While the characters in the story have been debating whether they should just accept their fate or try to fight it, I...went about normal school life. Mostly focused on maxing out social links and social stats. We did some exploration in Tartarus and a rescued a cat. Most of the characters seems to have expressed their resolve. What will happen on the next full moon?

** Genshin Impact
Originally a Portal 2 co-op stream, a lot of personal things happened to both me and my science partner and we decided to cancel. I also thought of cancelling this stream completely, but changed it to Genshin Impact instead. I mostly did dendro archon quest shtuff. It was a good stream, methinks!
