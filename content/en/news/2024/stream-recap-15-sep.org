#+SUMMARY: Mostly a normal week this week. Did a fun Maker Monday stream with elemental-themed icons and played a lot of fun games. You will not see Final Fantasy here...I had to cancel that stream.

* Art Stream
Made some elemental-themed icons for a request. I was requested to do quite a few of these little icons, so, I'll probably be devoting quite a few streams to getting them done. Still I managed to do like six of them in 2 hours so maybe it won't be too bad. Definitely have more to work on though.

* Game Streams
Explored Hollwnest a bit more and think I picked up a good charm to help with those dang knights, but still didn't quite squash 'em yet. I also didn't quite get out of that Gnosis and even had to cancel my stream on Friday! I /did/ beat two more large shadows though so I accomplished /something/!
** Hollow Knight
Again, mostly just explored Hollownest. I did pick up that new charm that let's me throw larva at enemies and that seems to do pretty good with those knights, but I didn't manage to beat them still. I have a feeling this will be a repeat of my fights with Hornet 😅 Hopefully they don't take quite that long though! I'll be taking a break from Hollow Knight for at least a week though so I can come back fresh and try again!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
I'm still stuck inside the Gnosis they call the Cathedral Ship. I decided to try and beat some optional sub-bosses even though I probably could have just saved them for later...same with the Unicorns, but at least I pretty much picked up everything. There's always next week to finally get out of this Gnosis!

** Persona 3 Reload
There was no stream on Friday due to a meeting, so we'll just skip straight to Saturday School, seems like a fitting punishment, no? In all seriousness, we did beat the bosses for this month and started working on stuff for the next. We even managed to max out a social link! What will the last shadow mean for us? Stay tuned!

* Next Week
 Next week the streams will mostly be on [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]], as usual, but there is one stream that will *not* be on there! Check my [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] for Saturday's stream! This will be a test to see how YouTube live streaming works. If it goes well, YouTube /may/ have more exclusive streams!
