* When?
There will be a special stream on 3 Jan to reveal the new outfit. This will be happening at a bit of an unusual time, 6 in the evening eastern and 3 in the afternoon pacific. The stream is scheduled to last about an hour, so please don't be late. Of course there will be an archive of the stream, but, it's not the same as being there!

* Who?
Every kitten! In other words, any and all who would like to see the new outfit are more than welcome to watch live!

* Where?
YouTube! The outfit reveal will take place on YouTube as this is the best platform, methinks, for these sorts of things. The stream will only be an hour and be mostly showing off the new outfit. I'll also talk about what it took to design it and reveal the secrets behind the design. Kittens are also more than welcome to participate in chat!

* Is this all? What about Twitch followers?
This is not all. The first stream utilizing the new outfit will be happening on the same day! I will not be leaving my Twitch Kittens out either! At 10 at night eastern or 7 in the evening pacific I'll be playing a game on Twitch and I'll be using the new outfit! Check my schedule for that week for which game I'm playing! I hope you all like the new outfit! I love designing new clothes!
