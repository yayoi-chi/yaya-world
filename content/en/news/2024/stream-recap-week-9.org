#+SUMMARY: Back to a regular stream schedule and not just streamining Final Fantasy games. I mean the first two streams were still kinda Final Fantasy-themed including a really fun art stream drawing some of my friends and kittens in Final Fantasy III/V jobs. It was a lot of fun! I also got passed the demon wall in IV and am actually nearing the end game now! I think I'll try to beat it this week!

* Art Stream
I did a special art stream this week! I drew Smol Yayoi in a devout outfit, but I also drew three of my friends in other jobs from Final Fantasy III/V. It was a lot of fun to draw a lot of characters in my smol character style. I'm going to be doing more smol-styled stuff because I'm happy I can doodle now! In fact next week's stream /might/ have another Smol Yayoi!

* Game Streams
Started with getting passed the demon wall in Final Fantasy IV because July wasn't quite over yet. I also returned to Hollownest to a difficult fight with Hornet, and I finished the week going back to school in Persona 3 Reload!
** Final Fantasy IV
We beat that wall! We also managed to get close to the end game. I didn't beat it yet, but, when you scroll down, you'll see it is on for next week! If I'm lucky I'll beat in then. Will I ever play V? We'll see!

More timey-whimey shtuff! In fact, there was a *lot* of time traveling back and forth. Just continuing to make some progress and having fun along the way!

** Hollow Knight
Yeah, this was a four hour stream. I'm getting good at those. It was also four hours of trying to beat Hornet. I got very consistent, but she's almost a worse wall than the demon wall. I'll get her next time!
