#+SUMMARY: Tried another day with two streams. Worked out a bit better! Well, probably because I had a holiday, but still. Really fun week that even included finishing Pokemon Sword!

* Art Stream
Started the week with my last kitten-sona (for now). This was of a special viewer of mine who had a very unique idea for their kitten. I love it and I think they do to! It was really fun to draw!

* Game Streams
Busy week this week! I managed to stream five different games o:! I was really surprised. Of course, a few of these were kind of short streams and one was on the same day as an art stream, but I still surprised myself. No embeds this week, check out the video links instead!
** Final Fantasy V
Made some more progress. It was a short stream, so not a lot of progress, but some progress nonetheless. I think this is becoming my favorite entry in the series and I would like to try a "Four Job Fiesta" one day, but we'll see!

** Hollow Knight
Tried a new strat with the rolling knights, but still didn't beat them. I got closer, but I think I need some more abilities or charms or a sharper nail or something. Either way, ended with some more exploration and found another optional boss....that also kicked my behind ðŸ˜…

** Xenosaga Episode 1
Finished with the dock colony for now. Now we are inside a Gnosis! I also managed to prove that MOMO is a magical girl! Hopefully we'll get out of this Gnosis soon.

** Persona 3 Reload
Did a lot of school stuff and some Tartarus stuff and even saved a cat! We're right at the next full moon though. I think this might be interesting. We'll see next time!

** Pokemon Sword
Finished Pokemon Sword \ ( ^ o ^ ) / It was really special showing off my all Eevee evolution team and beating the championship with them. this will not be the last time I stream a Pokemon game, and probably not even the last time for this game!
