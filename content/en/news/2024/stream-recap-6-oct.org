#+SUMMARY: After two art stream to design the ghost cat, I needed one more to get her ready for rigging! She's all done, but I can't use her just yet. So I debuted my smol Evee avatar this week instead!

* Art Stream
The ghost cat got cut up and ready for rigging, but I didn't do the rigging on stream. She is all rigged now, but it'll be a bit before I can use her. Hope you like watching the transformation though!

* Game Streams
The beginning of Spooky Month! We did spooky things in spooky games including Corpse Party and the game the freaked me out the most, A Plague Tale: Innocence!
** Corpse Party
I've played this before, but not this version. Not much changed in terms of story or game play, but, much like Higurashi, they updated visuals are nice! Just got through chapter one and decided to stop for now. Maybe we'll visit it again later in the month!

** Prey
I have also played this game before, but thought it would be a different type of spooky game for Spooky Month. I think I was right. It definitely spooked me ðŸ˜†

** Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly
For Throwback Thursday I thought one of the first horror games I ever played would be a good fit. It turns out the game is super hard to see for me and my viewers, but we powered through it and I think it'll be a bit easier to see now that I have the flashlight.

** A Plague Tale: Innocence
I wasn't expecting to be freaked out quite so much with this game, but I was. It was even worse that Corpse Party or Fatal Frame. I might be developing a rat phobia ðŸ˜… Except I still plan on playing it through Spooky Month at least so...maybe I like being freaked out ðŸ¤ª
