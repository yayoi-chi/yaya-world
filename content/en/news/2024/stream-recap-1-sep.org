#+SUMMARY: Shorter week because of a carpet install. Everything is looking great though and I'm loving my new room. I managed an art stream before the install and a few game streams after! Still a pretty nice week.

* Art Stream
Continued drawing some of my kittens! This week I drew my moderator as a cat and, since they are always napping, they wanted to be drawn asleep, kinda like my first picture of myself. Only I think they turned out a bit cuter. What do you think?

* Game Streams
The usual affair of games streamed this week. We continued exploring Hollowenest, met a new character in Xenosaga, and made just a bit of progress in Final Fantasy V. Check out the details below!
** Hollow Knight
I final unsealed the second dreamer! Headed for the third, but got stopped by some nasty rolling guards. Decided to better equip myself with maybe a stronger nail and some better abilities so it became another exploration stream! Hey, this is important because its my first time in Hollownest!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
This was a bit of a shorter stream. Most of my evening ones probably will be at least for awhile. We did manage to get through the Little Master's part and even got to the dock colony. Only really watched one scene though before calling it a nite. Just means more to do next week!

** Final Fantasy V
As is tradition, I got a little lost when I first started this. Fortunately chat helped me get back on track, thank you chat! Managed to get to the fire crystal and our next set of jobs. This was kind of a medium length stream, but we still managed to get a lot of progress, methinks.

* Next Week
Labor day means no work! It doesn't mean no stream though. Planning a special morning stream of Final Fantasy V followed by an evening Maker Monday. Adding Pokemon back into the bunch and getting back to Persona 3 Reload as well. Catch it all live on [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]]
