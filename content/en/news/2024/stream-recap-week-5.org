#+SUMMARY: I streamed all seven days this week...I don't think I'm going to do that again üòÖ

* Art Stream
As with last week, there was only one art stream. This will be the norm for most weeks from now on. Though I may do guerrilla art streams in the future, I will probably stick to only having one /scheduled/. For this week, I finished up the basic rigging on my model so I could debut her with some very basic movements.

* Game Streams
Even more games streams then last week so no embeds on this page. Please visit my [[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCawDd2ITxhS4DinK-fvkziw][channel page on YouTube]] to get a preview of all that happened. Check the headings for direct links to the videos themselves!

Wouldn't you know it, I got lost again üòÖ Fortunately, I new viewer really helped point me in the right direction and I made some really good progress going back and forth through time. All the time travel gives me a headache, but at least the story seems interesting so far. I'll definitely still be playing this....maybe for a bit too long üòÖ
** [[https://youtu.be/fA2Seg8W154][The Sims 4]]
Didn't make quite as much progress as I wanted to. I think I only complete like one aspiration task, but Smol is now a child! That's something right. Also, The Sims 4 breaks a *lot* just had to remind everyone üòÖ

After playing The Sims 4 for a bit too long, I wanted to stream something else, but Pok√©mon didn't load for me. Turns out, I had a corrupt SD card. Fortunately, I got it installed on the local storage and was able to stream it a day later! This also wouldn't be the only stream of it in the week!

With the basic rigging done, I set out to show off my model! There were some glitches, and still are, but I have them fixed in the next model! This would have been just a quick 30 minute stream...if I didn't decide to also play some more Pok√©mon, which I did üòù
** [[https://youtu.be/MN_5ZNwqjeM][Hollow Knight]]
I feel like this was the most unproductive Hollow Knight stream ever. Don't get me wrong I did get the super dash, which is my favorite ability, but then I just kind of wondered through Hollownest. I'm not sure where I want to go next, but I'll give it some thought and maybe have a direction to go next week!
