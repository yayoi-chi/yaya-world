#+SUMMARY: A week of new things! Started the week making a new frame for art streams and a new pngtuber for them too. Off stream I created a new game stream frame which debuted during a Persona stream and I even played a new game (well new for the channel)!

* Art Stream
This week I decided it was about time for a dedicated frame for art streams. I also used it to re-design the gaming stream frame and update all of my other graphics! Oh, did I mention Smol Painter Yayoi! No? Well she's in there!

* Game Streams
We start this week with some Persona, tried to beat hornet again, and then manage to introduce my viewers to one of my favorite RPGs from the PS2! The week ended with our attempt to finally finish Final Fantasy IV, but we didn't quite make it, almost though.
** Persona 3 Reload
Mostly made a lot of progress in Tartarus. Didn't really do much to advance the story other than move a couple of days down the calendar and advance a couple of social links. Unfortunately the controller died during the stream and I had some trouble with the USB cord ðŸ˜…

** Hollow Knight
Started with another attempt to beat Hornet, but didn't make it. Tried to see if I missed anything that could help. While I did pick up a few new charms and open a new area, I didn't really find anything else. Tried Hornet a few more times, but vowed to return once more with new strategies!

** Xenosaga Episode 1
By special request I introduced my audience to Xenosaga! This was one of my favorite RPGs growing up and it was really nice to get back to it. I've decided that Throwback Thursdays should be games like this, games I liked from when I was younger, or games I've played a lot. I will still get back to Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, but they will no longer be Throwback Thursday games, except for entries I played like VII and X

** Final Fantasy IV
Apparently the endgame of Final Fantasy IV was a lot longer than I thought. We beat the giant, but still have one last thing to take care of. Sadly, its a very long thing ðŸ˜… I did manage to get through most of the final dungeon, just a bit more!

* Next Week
How about a week with two art streams? Maybe with two streams on the same day too! Sure! Why not? Catch this special week on [[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]]. I'll be doing some special illustrations, get back to Xenosaga, and, with any luck, beat Hornet and finish Final Fantasy IV! Hope to see you all there ðŸ’œ
