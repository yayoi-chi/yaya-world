#+SUMMARY: A fun mixed back of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!

* Art Stream
This week's art stream was supposed to be something simple to get ready for my full debut. I needed some branding, which meant a name logo and banners for YouTube and Twitch. So this stream focused on that. I would even go on to make a new profile picture for Mastodon, Twitch, and YouTube using the cute art I made for the banner!

* Game Streams
Mostly I stuck to RPGs this week, but there was some Hollow Knight üòù
** Chrono Trigger
Went all the way back to 6.5 million BC and met an interesting cave woman like character. She gave us something we needed, but we ended up losing our gate key! Guess we'll have to get it back...in the next stream!

** Persona 3 Reload
Kind of a nothing burger of a stream, if I'm honest. There was a lot of dungeon exploration and I unlocked the Monad Passage. I also fought two gatekeepers in a row! Other than that, not much happened. If you're following the story though, you might want to still see this one

** FANTASIAN
Nope, we did not get our memory back! Well, we got part of it back, but not much. Did meet a princess. A princess that can fight and decided to join us despite our past with her...

** Hollow Knight
I started this one early and decided to finish the assets I was working on in the art stream, but we met a very creepy dreamer! Also, kind of still a little lost and missing some powers. Hopefully I can find them so I can find the other dreamers and unlock other parts of Hollownest and solve the mystery!
