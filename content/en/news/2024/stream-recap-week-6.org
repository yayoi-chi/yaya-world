#+SUMMARY: A fun mixed-bag of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!

* Art Stream
This week's art stream was supposed to be something simple to get ready for my full debut. I needed some branding, which meant a name logo and banners for YouTube and Twitch. So this stream focused on that. I would even go on to make a new profile picture for Mastodon, Twitch, and YouTube using the cute art I made for the banner!

* Game Streams
Mostly I stuck to RPGs this week, but there was some Hollow Knight 😝
** Chrono Trigger
Went all the way back to 6.5 million BC and met an interesting cave woman-like character. She gave us something we needed, but we ended up losing our gate key! Guess we'll have to get it back...in the next stream!

** Persona 3 Reload
Kind of a nothing burger of a stream, if I'm honest. There was a lot of dungeon exploration and I unlocked the Monad Passage. I also fought two gatekeepers in a row! Other than that, not much happened. If you're following the story though, you might want to still see this one

** FANTASIAN
Nope, we did not get our memory back! Well, we got part of it back, but not much. Did meet a princess. A princess that can fight and decided to join us despite our past with her...

** Hollow Knight
I started this one early and decided to finish the assets I was working on in the art stream, but we met a very creepy dreamer! Also, kind of still a little lost and missing some powers. Hopefully I can find them so I can find the other dreamers and unlock other parts of Hollownest and solve the mystery!
