#+SUMMARY: We had a sort of gacha week last week, and it was fun! We got back to our poor, neglected students in Blue Archive and continued our ADVENTURE in Natlan in Genshin Impact. I totally am not also drawing an outfit that is a purple version of Nahida, no, no, no!

* Art Streams
We finished the school uniform for my chibi and, totally not keeping on theme for the week, totally did *not* start an outfit that is a purple version of Nahida's outfit. You're just seeing things, it's still me!
* Game Streams
We had a sort of gacha week last week, and it was fun! We got back to our poor, neglected students in Blue Archive and continued our ADVENTURE in Natlan in Genshin Impact. Sadly, I couldn't have a whole week with gacha games. We needed to get back to our class trial in Danganronpa and I just had to start Dark Cloud 2. Hope the kittens didn't mind!
** Blue Archive
We missed many events! It was sad. I can't beleaf I neglected my students so much. Fortunately we still had main story to do and we checked in on the Make-Up Work Club. We found out an interesting secret purpose for the club, but it really didn't change much. We're still going to do our best to make sure everyone passes!

** Genshin Impact
The disaster in Natlan turned into in all out war. War is never pretty and I don't think Paimon was really prepared to see it. In fact, I wasn't really prepared either. We won the final battle, but the enemy is still out there. How will we be able to stop them? What price will be paid?

** Dark Cloud 2
Some parts of Dark Chronicles/Dark Cloud 2 are easier than the first game. We already have an evolved weapon and we got it before clearing the first dungeon. Somethings are a bit harder though. Have to watch health a bit more and guard and dodge more. We'll get into a rhythm though. We finished the first dungeon and started the second! Lots of fun!

** Danganronpa 2
We did it! We got passed the first trial. I didn't know they'd be so long. Hopefully they will always have an intermission. I am just happy we figured out how the killer really was and how the crime was actually committed. Got a little hairy for a second there!

* Next Week
[[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] and the [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] will have a cozy stream on the farm this week. I was going to say we're going to get cozy all week, but, is Hollow Knight cozy? I think it can be, as long as you stay out of Deepnest, what do you think?
