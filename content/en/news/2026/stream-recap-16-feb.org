#+SUMMARY: Not quite a full gacha week, but I did have some Wuthering Waves to make up because of scheduling to play it during maintenance last week so we had two Wuthering Waves streams. I also swapped Danganronpa out for Blue Archive so that is a lot of gachas! Didn't do anything gacha-themed for Maker Monday or Throwback Thursday though. I do have ideas for another week, however!

* Art Streams
Nothing gacha-themed here this week despite so many gacha games. I kept working on my four planel comic. I am still hoping all get good and fast at these cuz I would like to get more out quickly. We're almost on the third panel though so that's promising! Let's press on next week too!

Not quite a full gacha week, but I did have some Wuthering Waves to make up because of scheduling to play it during maintenance last week so we had two Wuthering Waves streams. I also swapped Danganronpa out for Blue Archive so that is a lot of gachas! Nothing gacha-like on Throwback Thursday though, maybe I'll think of something some other time!
** Wuthering Waves
*** 1st Stream
Had a couple of things left to take care of in Regunna. It was very helpful and I think we learned things that helped it all make a bit more sense. After that we headed back to the Black Shore and ended up with a rift that brought us to a new city that is somehow in a loop of a Lament. We met Chisa and now we're trying to find our way out! A mysterious mystery though.

*** 2nd Stream
Many mysterious mysteries, but we solved a lot of them. Actually I think we did a good job with Honami, the city we ended up in. We even managed to get Chisa out. She did almost immediately return, but the city isn't trapped any more and we got a nice party out of it, so it was good. Unfortunately, it seems a new mystery might just be unfolding!

** Dark Cloud 2
We decided we had gone far enough and our worry for Lin had us go back to check on her. Fortunately, we happened to get everything we needed to restore the bistro and even managed to get a secret ingredient for Miracle Dumplings. That was just what the doctor ordered to save Lin. We still have paths to walk though! We have to get to the lighthouse!

** Terraria
Night two went better than our first try. We are now very well equipped and we have lots of health. I even managed to max out my mana too and I have a purple rod. I am magical! Hope we have more fun next collab time.

** Blue Archive
We might be zeroing in on the imposter, but there are quite a lot of weird things happening in the Make-up Work Club. From books being discovered, to confessions of being a spy and having a mission, to discussing said mission. A lot of cwazy things happened. There's also someone who is apparently faking being a bad student who may actually be a genius. Lots of twists and turns!

* Next Week
[[https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi][Twitch]] and the [[https://www.youtube.com/@yayoi-chi][YouTube Channel]] will have some pretty normal streams I'll be going back to Genshin and Hollow Knight. I am almost at Nod-Krai in Genshin so almost caught up. Think I can get caught up before PS4 support ends?
