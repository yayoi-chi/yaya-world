#+SUMMARY: So, I kinda forgar about Lantern Rite in Genshin this year, well almost. Instead of going to Nod-Krai, I headed for Liyue and uhm...well...that bled into Hollow Knight too. I promise I'll stick to the schedule next week! We did finish and there was some Hollow Knight and even Dark Cloud 2 so not everything was effected 😅

* Art Streams
Almost done. I am beginning to wonder though, am I slow, or am I just having too much fun with chatting? I like art, but I think one of the main draws I have to the art streams is that I have more opportunities to chat with my kittens. So that probably won't change. Art is good, chats are even better!

** Genshin Impact
On our way to Nod-Krai we uhm.... stopped at Liyue for another Lantern Rite. I was hoping to just do a few things and continue on that journey, but I ended up getting sucked into mini-games and new stories. We weren't even able to finish so I started the next stream with Genshin too!

** Genshin Impact with Hollow Knight
We stopped near the end of the Lantern Rite quests on Genshin Impact last time. Seeing as I came in near the end of the event, I just had to finish it. So we started with that, but then we got to do a bit of Hollow Knight before we ended. We found a dream boss to fight and it is super intense. I keep getting to the second stage, but it keeps kicking my behind. Still better than the other one though. We'll get it!

** Dark Cloud 2
Lin got her memory back and we found an item that would let us travel back a bit to try and save Master Crest. Only our efforts didn't really help much. Fortunately, that Master Crest wasn't really the Master Crest who we needed. Turns out, well let's just say things worked out after all!

** Danganronpa 2
A plan was hatched to crash the girls' beach party. It wasn't a particularly good plan, but it was a plan, I guess. We did manage to catch some good sights and were even allowed to join the girls for their party. Thing is Mahiru didn't wanna come cuz she was not feeling well. Only she somehow ended up at the beach house and....became our next victim...
