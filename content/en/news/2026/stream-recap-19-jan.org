#+SUMMARY: We finished a couple more chibi outfits and am really proud of them. I wasn't sure about the new Hollow Knight one at first, but it's growing on me. Speaking of, we went back to Hollownest to try and get the dreamers. I managed to get one, but the other one is being difficult. Well we'll get it, just like we took care of all those infested areas in Stardew Valley. Hopefully it won't be be like how twicky the Rainbow Butterfly Woods are turning out to be though. On the bright side, we did solve our first case in Danganronpa 2!

We finished a couple more chibi outfits and am really proud of them. I wasn't sure about the knew Hollow Knight one at first, but it's growing on me. Once again though, I wasn't quite able to get a timelapse completed on time for this post. I did finally move all the recordings so I can edit them, but you'll have to wait until next week to see if I have them up on YouTube!

** Hollow Knight
I had forgotten that there is a particularly difficult fight with 6 (or maybe 5) tough enemies before the dreamer in City of Tears. Am hoping that is the only trial for getting it. After some directions and discussion from the kittens, we decided to head over and finish of Deepnest for a charm and I got that dreamer too, cuz Deepnest itself is that one's trial. Went back to City of Tears with a new strat and a new charm. Just need to doing it now!

** Stardew Valley
Just another cozy few days on the farm. There were a few less cozy moment when we ended up in infested areas in the mines. Please don't keel me! Am really not tasty! We did also get a bigger house and the seasons have changed from autumn to winter. Also, yes, there was a lot of fishing. Fishing feeds me in the mines and makes me a lot of money!

** Dark Cloud 2
We traversed the Rainbow Butterfly Woods and found the missing Firbits. Holly is still missing, but with all the Firbits found we can now start rebuilding the world. Still going to look for Holly, of course. Maybe the Rainbow Butterfly Woods hold secrets to helping us restore Jurak!

** Danganronpa 2
We heard the verdict and the murder was punished. Of course, after hearing why he did it and that his target wasn't the victim it made it a little hard to see him get punished especially the way he did. We're officially down two students now. We all promised to do our best. We don't know at what, be we promised. Hopefully we can somehow find away off this island before someone else dies...
