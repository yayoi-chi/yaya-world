Hello Everypeep!

Well, it finally happened, the third game in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)][Persona series]] has made it to [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809700/Persona_3_Portable/][steam]]. Persona 3 was always a super interesting game and kind of one of the darkest in the series. I really look forward to finally finishing it, and on my Steam Deck too! Like with [[{{%ref "/guides/p4g" %}}][Person 4 Golden]] I will be creating guides as I play through. I haven't quite started yet, since I'm still working through that game, but I figured I'd get things going here just in case I decide to play them at the same time ðŸ˜‰.
