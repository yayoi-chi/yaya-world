Hello Everypeep!

Not only did Persona 3 hit steam, but it got a remake ü•≥ I've said what I needed to say about Persona 3 in my [[][Persona 3 Portable]] guide's introduction. Needless to say I was excited to get this remake so get it I did üòù I'm working on these guides alongside playing the game like I have been doing. I'm also playing P3P while I play P3 Reload. Its a bit dissorienting because I'm not at the same place in both games, but its been interesting seeing what is the same and what has changed this way. Anyway, on to the guide!
