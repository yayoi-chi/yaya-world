The first layer starts at the Netherworld Gate is fairly small and pretty easy to traverse! Perfect for red whistles.

Getting to Waterfall Gondola is very easy as following a path will pretty much get you there and you won't need any supplies. Getting to the Twin Falls gate is a little more tricky, but, if you have two ropes, it can be done fairly easily.
