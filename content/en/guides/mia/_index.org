Hello everypeep ðŸ˜„!

So I got a new game for you all, but it is definitely not an easy one. I'm actually not going to give you much of a walkthrough on this one. I don't think that this is really /that/ kind of game. Its more of a "here's a story and your welcome to follow it, but also just explore how you want" kind of game. What I /will/ do, is give you some tips and also a few helpful maps of The Abyss in [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324340/Made_in_Abyss_Binary_Star_Falling_into_Darkness/][Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness]]!
