#+SUMMARY: We go over some builds like All SPR, all STR, and more with their pros, cons, and best classes

For some context, it's important to know that Fiest Online has six
classes. Each class is best suited to a particular role such as Damange
Dealer (DD), Damage over Time (DoT), Area of Effect (AoE), Tank, or
Support. I won't go into details as to which class works best in which
role as that is laid out very well on
[[https://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/classes][Fiesta's Main Site]]. However
builds can be tricky since each class has its own strength and
weaknesses while its leveling such that what works for Archers my not
work for Mages (even though they both specialize in AoE). So, here are
the generally accepted builds and what classes to use with them 😉.

** All STR
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: all-str
   :END:
This is easy as from the start, you just dump all of your skill points
into STR. At first this seems like a really good build for all
characters, but a character without DEF dies 😵. One might be tempted to
use this for a tank role, but tanks are supposed to take dmg not give
it. Really the only classes where this build works is Crusader, as they
have good DEF by default and also have support skills, and Fighter
(Gladiator Specifically) that focus more on DD roles than tanking.

** Full END
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: full-end
   :END:
Like All STR, full END just has you dump all of your points in one stat,
in this case END. This will maximize your health and defenses. This is
well suited for support classes, especially clerics, and tanks. People
tend do die if the clericor tank dies so the more defense and HP they
have the better.

** Totally DEX
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: totally-dex
   :END:
Dumping all your points into DEX may seem odd, but some classes can
really utilize this well. Besides who needs DEF if the mobs can't even
hit you 🤪. Keep in mind though, you are sacrificing your potential in
other areas. This really only makes since when you can kill fairly
quickly too, so only DDs really, and you will still need some DEF. Just
be careful with this one.

** Pure SPR
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pure-spr
   :END:
I'm listing this just because its a possibility to maximize your
character's SP, M.DEF, and crit rate, but you will need very good gear
or you still won't do much dmg and will probably die a lot too 😅.

/Classes/:

** 33 DEX/Rest STR
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dexrest-str
   :END:
The above DD build (All STR) is great, but it ignores aim. Sprinkling in
a few points to SPR, until you have 33 (or maximum of 67) fixes this
helping your DD hit more often. This build is well suited for all those
recommended for the All STR builds.

/Classes/:

** 25 SPR/Rest END
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sprrest-end
   :END:
The above support build (Full END) is also great, but it ignores SP and
crit rate. You can sprinkle in a few points into SPR until you have 25
to fix this, I highly recommend this build for Holy Knights since they
tend to burn through available SP, also anyone in a support role can use
some extra crits when they need to solo 😉.

/Classes/:

** 25 SPR/33 DEX/Rest STR
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: spr33-dexrest-str
   :END:
This build maximize your attack power and crit rate while making it you
a hard target to hit. You can use gear to help with DEF and M.DEF.

/Classes/:

** 50 END/33 DEX/25 SPR/Rest STR
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: end33-dex25-sprrest-str
   :END:
If you're looking for a wellrounded build that is nearly perfect for
player-versus-player (PVP), this is the build for you. A reminder
though, this is a jack-of-all-trades/master-of-none type situation, and
many classesw have gear and armor to help with stats like END.
