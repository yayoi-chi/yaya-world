The Lucky House can be entered by speaking to the Lucky House Guide in
the following towns:

- Alberstroll Ruins

/Note/: Your character must be at least level 40 to enter the Lucky
House.

The Lucky House is a place where you can exchange in-game gems, gold,
etc for coins that can be used for a variety of gambling games. These
games are pretty entertaining for a bit and, like all gambling, are a
way to win more coins to exchange for gems. However, there is something
else you can do with these coins. You can purchase one of four types of
capsules that have a variety of prizes in them. There are two capsule
vendors with two tiers of capsules in each one. The prizes are as
