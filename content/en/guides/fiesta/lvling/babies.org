#+SUMMARY:

The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level
character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their
are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money
or you can find me and I'll do it for free, if I have the time. The
fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your
characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full
exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr. If you
can't get a spot I suggest having someone kill Guardian Masters for you.
This is still fairly fast and there are several spots this can be done
at. This is my favorite way to level. It isn't as fast or exciting as
FM, but it does the trick.

If this isn't an option for you, or you'd rather take your time and
experience the various areas of the game, then there are quests you can
do at this level. All the regular quests are fairly easy and fast up to
about level 30. In fact, in my opinion, this is the most fun way to
level especially if you have a friend or two to level babies with. Below
are a few repeatables you can do together to make things faster,
especially after level 30, if you want ðŸ˜‰

* What to do at level 40?

Those were not all the repeatable quests and you probably won't need to
complete a majority of them to reach level 40. For more information on
quests you can visit the [[http://fiesta-wiki.com/quests/4][Fiesta
Wiki]]. This will also help you complete pre-requisite quests for some
of the reps above. Once your baby hits level 40 it is time for the Tower
of Iyzel. Just because they are level 40, however, doesn't mean that can
beat the tower on their own. If you have a few friends, this could be
pretty easy, but, if not, I should have an runner that can help you.
Head to Roumen, visit Templar Maria and pick up all the quests that
mention the tower than find a runner or get your party together and head
to Forest of Mist to find the tower itself. With all the quests picked
up, one run should get you to level 41 or 42. Congrats, you're not a
baby anymore ðŸ¥³!
