#+SUMMARY: I write some rpg and game guides and walkthroughs!

Welcome ðŸ˜„!

Here is a collection of guides and walkthroughs for various games. I have already added quite a few different games, most are single-player games, though there are some guides for Fiesta. I'm not usually good at working out the best way to level or build a character in other MMO's because I mostly play solo anyway, when possible, and don't care about every little stat boost. Fiesta was an exception, not the rule. Single-player games can be a bit trickier and sometimes learning those tricks are entirely necessary to complete the story (I'm looking at you Final Fantasy X). Anyway, that's why I've written the guides I have. I hope they help chu!
