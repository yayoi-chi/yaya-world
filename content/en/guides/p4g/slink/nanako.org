#+SUMMARY:

Nanako is Ryotaro Dojima's daughter, which makes her your cousin. Though her age isn't specified she appears to be between six and eight, but she is surprisingly mature for her age. This is probably because she had to grow up rather quickly after the death of her mother. Nanako's story is very cute and was one of my favorites in to work through in my game. Her S-Link will start automatically as part of the game's story.

* Availability
Nanako is available just about any night so long as Doujima is not around. Of course those specific days are not listed, its just a matter of paying attention. Trust me though, you'll have plenty of time to work on her S-Link if you don't neglect her.
| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday | Rainy |
|--------+---------+-----------+----------+--------+----------+--------+-------|
| Night  | Night   | Night     | Night    | Night  | Night    | Night  | Anytime |
All this said, keep in mind that, unlike most S-Links, Nanako's has a hard cut-off. The last day to get her to Rank 10 will be 10/31!

* Dialog Options
I'll try to keep just the questions and the options here to prevent spoilers, but that is *not* guaranteed! For your information something like "Rank 1>2" means going from rank 1 to rank 2. Also, the number after the "+" is the number of notes each choice nets you which affects how quickly you move to the next rank.
