#+SUMMARY: Guides for social links, and dungeons as well as general walkthroughs for the remake version of Persona 4 (Persona 4: Golden). Some information in these guides may be applicable to the original PS2 version, but this is not guaranteed

Hello everypeep 😄!

This is my first collection of guides for a game other than [[{{% ref "guides/fiesta" %}}][Fiesta Online]]. For this collection I also decided not to do a guide for an MMO, but, instead, create a guide for a more traditional game. This was originally a PS2 game, and was also JRPG. It wasn't the first of the genre that I played, but it is certainly a favorite of mine. Of course, I don't own the original version, so the content of this guide is actually based off a remake that was done called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_4#Persona_4_Golden][Persona 4: Golden]]. I have the [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/][Steam version]], but this should be applicable to other versions as long as they are the remake and not the original, though I'm betting a lot of this will still be applicable there, I have no way of testing that for sure.
