#+SUMMARY:

At level 95 you can begin doing daily quests. Daily quests reset every
day at 00:00 in-game time, meaning once you turn them in they are done,
but you can pick em up again the next day. From levels 90-125 you can
pick up quests by purchasing a mission scroll from the mission board in
Elderine. Talk to Verylo (who is standing next to the board) to actually
pick up the quest. You will also turn in your quests to him.

It should be noted (again, because no one told me) that mission scroll
cost money. You usually make enough from turning in the quest to cover
the cost of it, and then some, but you need to make that payment
upfront, so watch your money 😉

I have just reached this point, so I don't know the all particulars on how these work yet. For now I'll just list the quest, and any prequests you need to unlock them. Don't forget to visit the [[http://fiesta-wiki.com/quests/13][Fiesta Wiki]] if you need help following these quest trains or other unlocking steps. It should also be noted that much of this was written /before/ the 140 cap raise and it appears this quests may be available up until 140, I'll update if I find one that isn't.

- Ursula's Mad Garden (lvl 130-140)
- Enter the Dark Portal (130-140, prequest "Unusual Behavior", both this and the prequest appear to require a special item)

  drop in Twilight Void)
