The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level
character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their
are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money
or you can find me and I&amp;#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The
fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your
characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full
exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr. If you
can&amp;#39;t get a spot I suggest having someone kill Guardian Masters for you.
This is still fairly fast and there are several spots this can be done
at. This is my favorite way to level. It isn&amp;#39;t as fast or exciting as
FM, but it does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you
can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few
repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You
can see the guide for babies for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable
quests in order to level quickly and efficiently. In some cases you can
gain up to four levels in a less than an hour, if you can catch the
right quests. For now though, it is best to exploit Tower of Iyzel to
get you to 41 or 42 than you should run around completing various 40-42
level quests until you reach level 43.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you have followed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/&#34;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; so
far then you&amp;#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power
leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow
depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the
friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

How best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions
on how things can be done at this stage too. For this stage I&amp;#39;m going to
give you a few options for some of the levels. If you have the friends
and money they&amp;#39;ll help you level really quickly, if you don&amp;#39;t than you
can still solo, or work with a group of close friends your level, and
still level, but it&amp;#39;ll be slower.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
After following &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/&#34;&gt;my guide&lt;/a&gt; thus far
you&amp;#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really
hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods
and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully,
you&amp;#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have managed to collect a
lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are
still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through
so onward to ADVENTURE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
When I first wrote my last &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/&#34;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next. Well cap is 140 now so I guess it&amp;#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. So, here&amp;#39;s some ideas of what you can do. The same caveat exists with this guide as with the last one. My current highest level character is 140, but she is a cleric, so I have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tried some of these suggestions alone. If you have better suggestions, though, let me know, you can comment on this page with a GitHub account, or send me an e-mail!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
