        <description>Nanako is Ryotaro Dojima&amp;#39;s daughter, which makes her your cousin. Though her age isn&amp;#39;t specified she appears to be between six and eight, but she is surprisingly mature for her age. This is probably because she had to grow up rather quickly after the death of her mother. Nanako&amp;#39;s story is very cute and was one of my favorites in to work through in my game. Her S-Link will start automatically as part of the game&amp;#39;s story.</description>

        <description>Marie is a girl you meet in the Velvet Room. She usually sits on the other side of Igor, though some times she seems to be missing only to return fairly quickly usually after you discover one of her poems. After 04/18 you will see in option under &amp;#34;check on dwellers&amp;#34; in the velvet room to &amp;#34;listen to Marie&amp;#39;s request&amp;#34;. This will allow you to befriend Marie and start her social link.</description>
