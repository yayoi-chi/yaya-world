        <description>Ayane is a first year student and a member of the school&amp;#39;s band. She is also one potential love-interest for the protagonist. You&amp;#39;ll unlock her as soon as culture clubs are available.
Availability Ayane is available during band club meetings. The schedule for band club is available on the Job &amp;amp; Clubs page.
Dialog Options To keep things spoiler-free, I won&amp;#39;t give you the context for these questions or their answers.</description>

        <description>I won&amp;#39;t give too much information about Teddie. Teddie is Teddie and Teddie is a party member and persona-user, somehow. You&amp;#39;ll automatically start and rank this social link during the story.
Availability Depending on how you look at it Teddie is not really ever available. You don&amp;#39;t get the option to hang out with him outside of story events and other S-Links. This isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing because it is actually one of the easiest S-Links to rank as it happens automatically during normal story events.</description>

        <description>Yumi is a member of the School&amp;#39;s Drama club. She becomes available once you unlock culture clubs.
Availability Yumi is available whenever the drama club meets. See the page on Jobs &amp;amp; Clubs for the club schedules.
Dialog Options This may shock you, but Yumi and Ayane are different characters and have different stories. I&amp;#39;ll do my best to avoid spoilers while preparing you with the dialog options that will best help you, as usual, please play Yumi story to feel in the blanks.</description>

        <description>Rise is idol named &amp;#34;Rise-chi (or Risette if you&amp;#39;re a barbarian)&amp;#34; who may have suffered from a bit of burnout and is now seeking a break from that work and a quieter life back in her home town.
Availability You&amp;#39;ll start this Social Link automatically 7/23 after you complete the Marukyu Striptease dungeon. You&amp;#39;ll usually find her on the first floor of the high school or in front of the tofu shop in the central shopping district on the days listed below.</description>

        <description>Nanako is Ryotaro Dojima&amp;#39;s daughter, which makes her your cousin. Though her age isn&amp;#39;t specified she appears to be between six and eight, but she is surprisingly mature for her age. This is probably because she had to grow up rather quickly after the death of her mother. Nanako&amp;#39;s story is very cute and was one of my favorites in to work through in my game. Her S-Link will start automatically as part of the game&amp;#39;s story.</description>

        <description>Marie is a girl you meet in the Velvet Room. She usually sits on the other side of Igor, though some times she seems to be missing only to return fairly quickly usually after you discover one of her poems. After 04/18 you will see in option under &amp;#34;check on dwellers&amp;#34; in the velvet room to &amp;#34;listen to Marie&amp;#39;s request&amp;#34;. This will allow you to befriend Marie and start her social link.</description>
