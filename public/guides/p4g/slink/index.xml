        <description>I won&amp;#39;t give too much information about Teddie. Teddie is Teddie and Teddie is a party member and persona-user, somehow. You&amp;#39;ll automatically start and rank this social link during the story.
Availability Depending on how you look at it Teddie is not really ever available. You don&amp;#39;t get the option to hang out with him outside of story events and other S-Links. This isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing because it is actually one of the easiest S-Links to rank as it happens automatically during normal story events.</description>

        <description>Rise is idol named &amp;#34;Rise-chi (or Risette if you&amp;#39;re a barbarian)&amp;#34; who may have suffered from a bit of burnout and is now seeking a break from that work and a quieter life back in her home town.
Availability You&amp;#39;ll start this Social Link automatically 7/23 after you complete the Marukyu Striptease dungeon. You&amp;#39;ll usually find her on the first floor of the high school or in front of the tofu shop in the central shopping district on the days listed below.</description>

        <description>Nanako is Ryotaro Dojima&amp;#39;s daughter, which makes her your cousin. Though her age isn&amp;#39;t specified she appears to be between six and eight, but she is surprisingly mature for her age. This is probably because she had to grow up rather quickly after the death of her mother. Nanako&amp;#39;s story is very cute and was one of my favorites in to work through in my game. Her S-Link will start automatically as part of the game&amp;#39;s story.</description>

        <description>Marie is a girl you meet in the Velvet Room. She usually sits on the other side of Igor, though some times she seems to be missing only to return fairly quickly usually after you discover one of her poems. After 04/18 you will see in option under &amp;#34;check on dwellers&amp;#34; in the velvet room to &amp;#34;listen to Marie&amp;#39;s request&amp;#34;. This will allow you to befriend Marie and start her social link.</description>
