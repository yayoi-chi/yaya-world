[{"content":" This is an original story. The story is written in first person, please note that the thoughts and feelings expressed in this story are those of the character, Nagisa, and not those of the author, Yayoi. Thank you!\nJust Press \u0026#34;Go Live!\u0026#34; I stared at my screen. My heart was racing. Management had given me a checklist of things I needed to do before now and they sent over all the files and assets I needed. Yesterday I had updated my streaming software and linked it to my online account. I put together a little script of what I would do and say about myself, or rather, little Nanako (the character the agency had assigned me), and submitted it to my manager. She approved everything this morning and said all I had to do was get everything set up and press \u0026#34;Go Live\u0026#34;. Yeah that was easier said then done. First of all the software didn\u0026#39;t have a \u0026#34;Go Live\u0026#34; button, it said \u0026#34;Start Streaming\u0026#34;. I knew that already though, but that wasn\u0026#39;t the problem.\nI know just enough about computers to get by, but setting up the scenes and everything was a bit more difficult. You see Nanako, my little live avatar, was supposed to animate based on my head and lip movements, but that wasn\u0026#39;t working at first. They also sent me over a few streaming backgrounds and frames I could use, but the software wasn\u0026#39;t displaying those right and I had to do an update before it would work. I\u0026#39;m also not sure how to show my screen. That last part isn\u0026#39;t important right now. I won\u0026#39;t need to do that for debut, but the contract says, under the heading \u0026#34;engagement\u0026#34; that I was supposed to play games on stream for my fans, which I was not sure how to do. I even had my first one already scheduled. I took a breath. I already e-mailed my manager about that and she\u0026#39;s looking into it. Right now, I just need to focus on debuting Nanako.\nThe background was set up now. Nanako moved when she was supposed, she even blinked with me now. I took a deep breath and watched the clock. \u0026#34;Three minutes to debut!\u0026#34; I told myself. I quickly sent a text out to my family and friends reminding them that I had work and not to bother me. I checked the pickups and gates on the microphone to make sure that only my adorable voice would be heard and checked off the second to last item on the checklist. \u0026#34;Two minutes\u0026#34; I updated.\nI took one deep breath than began tracing my fingers. I breathed in as I went up one side, breathed out as I went down the other and repeated it for all five fingers. \u0026#34;Everyone is nervous when they start,\u0026#34; my manager had told me in my last virtual meeting. She told me about the technique just after that. \u0026#34;They\u0026#39;re here to meet Nanako,\u0026#34; I reminded myself. That\u0026#39;s right, no one cared about Nagisa, they wanted Nanako, and Nanako had no background or baggage beyond the brief blurb some agency writer just put together for me to read during the debut. Those on the other end of the screen, they had no expectations for me. \u0026#34;Just have fun,\u0026#34; my manager had added before logging off of that meeting. \u0026#34;Just have fun,\u0026#34; I repeated now.\nA message popped up. It was from my manager. \u0026#34;Good luck!\u0026#34; she said. \u0026#34;You got this!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Its time!\u0026#34; I said. I pressed \u0026#34;Start Stream\u0026#34;. After a little wait connecting I played the first asset my manager sent over, an opening animation.\nHello Nanako! A young girl at the audience. She stood, just under five feet tall, on the center of the stage, a starry background behind her. She closed one eye and tilted her head. Anyone who saw the petite frame on stage and paired it with that wink would probably think what stood before them was a child. That didn\u0026#39;t matter. What happened next would have surprised anyone.\nThe stars suddenly disappeared and all light left the room. The audience, in a mixture of surprise, excitement, and fear, cried out. \u0026#34;Nanako!\u0026#34; they said \u0026#34;Nanako!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Starry starry smile!\u0026#34; the girl said. The room was soon filled with a bright light in a flurry of fluid motions the girl in front of them transformed into what could only be described as a magical girl, complete with a cute outfit and a little wand.\nThe background of stars returned and the girl smiled at the audience once more. \u0026#34;I am your new idol, Nanako!\u0026#34; she said. \u0026#34;I hope we all have a lot of fun together. I like singing, of course, and a love making new friends, so I hope we can all get a long!\u0026#34; the crowed cheered loudly. \u0026#34;Now many idols would use their time to talk about themselves, but don\u0026#39;t you all find that just a little boring?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;No,\u0026#34; said one fan.\n\u0026#34;Yeah!\u0026#34; said another.\n\u0026#34;Let\u0026#39;s do something new!\u0026#34; said a third.\n\u0026#34;Well I could tell you my age and where I\u0026#39;m from and all that stuff, my three sizes are secret though,\u0026#34; Nanako gave her fans a wink, \u0026#34;but, why don\u0026#39;t we start with a song? I mean, idols sing right? So I should just sing for you, right, right?\u0026#34; The crowd cheered and the girl took a deep breath, the stage lights dimmed leaving only her in the spot light with a standing microphone. The girl opened her mouth and began to sing.\nYou\u0026#39;ll do Alright! In the end I never revealed the age of my character. The designer had stated that, like me, Nanako was 19, but my manager felt that she might appeal to a wider audience if a certain set of them were completely unaware of her age. I brought up some of the other details my character\u0026#39;s designer had written up, but I did this between sets. I had gone over this with my manager. I told her I wanted to sing, and, though I did like the magical girl theme they came up with for Nanako, I wanted to be known more as an idol. After hearing me sing, my manager agreed that the faster we planted that image in the heads of the fans the less jarring it would be when Nanako did more singing later. So we had both come up with the idea of making her debut more of a Karaoke stream.\n\u0026#34;Great job!\u0026#34; my manager messaged just as I ended the short, 35 minute stream. \u0026#34;I think they really enjoyed your singing, I know I did.\u0026#34; she added.\nI teased my schedule, including my next stream, which was going to be on Sunday. It was going to be a gaming stream. I wasn\u0026#39;t a fan of this part, but my manager said it was important as it was one of the easiest way for a young virtual idol to engage with fans. Now, I don\u0026#39;t mind playing games. It wasn\u0026#39;t the first thing that came to mind when I had free time, but I found some of them fun, especially visual novels, but I was going to have to play a variety of games and I wasn\u0026#39;t sure I\u0026#39;d be good at any of them. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m really worried about Sunday\u0026#39;s stream,\u0026#34; I messaged back to my manager.\n\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re playing a casual racing game,\u0026#34; she messaged back. \u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t worry about your driving, just have fun. If you don\u0026#39;t seem very good, just laugh it off, and say you haven\u0026#39;t played in awhile. The important thing is just to have fun.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll try,\u0026#34; I typed.\n\u0026#34;You will! Don\u0026#39;t worry.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Nagisa,\u0026#34; my brother called, \u0026#34;aren\u0026#39;t you done with your stream?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m talking with my manager,\u0026#34; I replied.\n\u0026#34;Well, the bath is ready.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay.\u0026#34; I just sent my manager a smile (üôÇ) emoji and told her I\u0026#39;m signing off for the night. She sent a thumbs up (üëçüèª) and I headed off to the bath.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"adventures","tags":["nagisa","original","adventures","rebase"],"title":"RE[BASE] Nagisa: Debut!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/nagisa_ep1/"},{"content":" This is an original story.

Thank you!\nAbout Me Hello everyone! I was in Discord not too long ago with a friend of mine. He\u0026#39;s a programmer and said he worked on one of my favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing games, oh god, spelling all that out is rough, no wonder we usually just say MMORPG, anyway, he said the first thing he learns how to do when he learns a new programming language is print \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;. He said it is different and sometimes it isn\u0026#39;t even something you print to a user\u0026#39;s screen, not even sure how it would work when learning to build a video game, but I like it! So instead of \u0026#34;Hello everyone!\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;ll change it to Hello world!\nHello world! My name is Allana, I am thirteen years old and I used to spend time outside of school just playing video games. I know, so weird for a girl, right? I mean what self-respecting teenage girl would just go to school, barely talk to anyone, then come home and spend the rest of her day playing video games? Like no one right?\nWell, I do! I guess I should explain a few things about me before we go on. I mean, you\u0026#39;re going to be getting to know a lot about me, I think. I mean that\u0026#39;s the plan. Its the whole reason I\u0026#39;m writing this. So here, we go! I am, how did Tabitha put it, adorably shy. I don\u0026#39;t like to talk to anyone except my sister, that\u0026#39;s Tabitha, and maybe a couple of people in class, Momo is kind of nice and very understanding and cute and I should probably move on before this whole thing ends up all about Momo. Anyway, when I am called on, I shuffle in my seat awkwardly and try to talk until the teacher calls on someone else. I\u0026#39;m not stupid, and it isn\u0026#39;t just Momo and Tabitha that say that, I just can\u0026#39;t handle other people. Because I\u0026#39;m like that, anyone who approaches me to talk, even if they are just asking how my weekend was, ends up with the same mumbling mess the teacher gets and usually Momo steps in. To be honest, I\u0026#39;m not really sure how I ended up friends with Momo. I do remember when we first met. It was back in elementary school‚Ä¶\nHello Momo! There I was that one fateful day at the beginning of fall quarter. I had just entered the fourth grade and was gearing up for another year of stammering and stumbling and awkwardly trying to make it through each day. Little did I know, this would be a far more awkward day then I have ever experienced.\nFirst, when I sat down I just about slid right out of my chair. I manged to catch myself before my bum hit the floor, but not before my brand new skirt caught the edge of the chair and was just about yanked straight up. I stood quickly and straightened by skirt, but now everyone was staring at me. I blushed and sat down almost as quickly as I stood up. I put my head between my arms, on my desk, and closed my eyes hoping I would soon no longer feel the burning gaze of my classmates on my back.\nJust as I was beginning to feel comfortable, I heard something. \u0026#34;Allana,\u0026#34; it was faint but familiar, \u0026#34;Allana!\u0026#34; Was someone saying my name? \u0026#34;ALLANA!!\u0026#34; My head shot up. The teacher had been calling me. He shook his head. \u0026#34;Come to the board and solve this problem!\u0026#34; It was probably my worst nightmare. In third grade me and my teacher had an understanding, if she didn\u0026#39;t call on me during class, I would stay late each day and help her clean up. Actually, I liked my third grade teacher, she was very nice, and would even let me help her grade quizzes and look over lesson plans. Of course, I was in fourth grade now, and had a completely different teacher. I think this was even his first year at this school.\nI slowly stood up, with shaking legs, and tried to make my way to the front of the class. I kept my head down so I wouldn\u0026#39;t see the faces of my classmates. If I couldn\u0026#39;t see them then maybe, just maybe, they would all disappear and this would be easier. Of course, that isn\u0026#39;t how things worked and my heart just kept racing faster and faster until I got to the board. My eyes couldn\u0026#39;t even focus on what was written. \u0026#34;Teach!\u0026#34; someone called.\n\u0026#34;No one help her!\u0026#34; the teacher, obviously angry, he probably thought I was sleeping, shouted.\n\u0026#34;Dude, you stupid something?\u0026#34; the voice continued. At first I thought it was talking about me and I was just about ready to cry, but something really unexpected happened.\n\u0026#34;Excuse me!?\u0026#34; the teacher asked, even more enraged.\n\u0026#34;Do you have any idea who you just called up?\u0026#34; the voice continued. The teacher, either shocked by the student\u0026#39;s blatant disrespect, or just unsure about the question, remained quite. \u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s Allana, she never comes up to the board, and I mean never. Hell you\u0026#39;re lucky she made it this far. If I were you I\u0026#39;d have her go sit right back down before we have to get the nurse.\u0026#34;\nThe voice was probably referring to another time I was called up at the end of second grade. I had collapsed and woke up in the nurse\u0026#39;s office. Guess they were worried that would happen again. Maybe they even thought that\u0026#39;s why I was never up in third grade. \u0026#34;Listen!\u0026#34; The teacher shouted \u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t appreciate my students telling me how to teach. You will ALL sit quietly and wait for her to finish the problem!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Hell, its your funeral, but won\u0026#39;t you look like just the worst teacher if she does pass out. You think we\u0026#39;ll have any respect left you then?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;First, watch you language! Second, if you\u0026#39;re so worried, why don\u0026#39;t you come up and solve it for her then!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Fine!\u0026#34; the voice replied. Next thing I knew I was on my way back to my seat and another girl was up at the bored. She made a complete mess of trying to solve a math problem, but at least I wasn\u0026#39;t up there any more. Only things weren\u0026#39;t quite over.\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s utterly wrong,\u0026#34; the teacher said. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll see both of you after class.\u0026#34; The girl dropped the chalk and stomped back to her seat.\nI tried to sneak away after class, but the girl came right up to my desk just before I stood up. \u0026#34;Where do you think your going?\u0026#34; she questioned.\n\u0026#34;I-I-\u0026#34; I started.\n\u0026#34;Relax, I\u0026#39;m just messing with you.\u0026#34; The girl said. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m Momo.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;A-A-\u0026#34; I tried to tell her my name, but it kept getting stuck.\n\u0026#34;Allana,\u0026#34; I know. \u0026#34;I transferred in last year. Heard a bit about you. Some people think your the most stuck up bitch in class, oh oops. Sorry my mom is always threatening to wash my mouth out.\u0026#34; The girl place her hand on the back of her head and tried to look embarrassed, \u0026#34;Umm.. anyway I didn\u0026#39;t believe them. You seem very sweet, if not a little shy.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Are you two delinquents finished introducing yourselves?\u0026#34; someone asked.\n\u0026#34;Not yet, but go ahead teach, you want to chew someone out, you got me! You can let Allana go home!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re ten, you better learn how to respect your elders.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah, yeah,\u0026#34; said Momo, \u0026#34;I heard that before. You going to let Allana go home or what?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Allana!\u0026#34; the man began. \u0026#34;Were you sleeping in class?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Dude, what is your deal!?\u0026#34; Momo asked. \u0026#34;Just let it go, she wasn\u0026#39;t sleeping in class.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m sure she can speak for herself!\u0026#34; the teacher exclaimed.\n\u0026#34;Are you!?\u0026#34; Momo shouted. \u0026#34;Do you even know her? Seems like you\u0026#39;re making a lot of assumptions and do you know what that makes you?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;If you say it, I\u0026#39;ll send you straight to‚Ä¶\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;The principle\u0026#39;s office? Yeah me and him are very close. Listen, Allana is shy, not a delinquent, so just learn more about people before you judge them. I\u0026#39;ll see myself to the principle, but I\u0026#39;ll also be more than happy to tell him all about what you\u0026#39;re doing to Allana, in graphic detail, if you know what I mean.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Fine! Allana, you can go home.\u0026#34; I wasn\u0026#39;t sure what exactly Momo was implying when she said that or how it got him to change his attitude so quickly, but I was glad it was all over.\nJust before we parted ways, I did something I never thought I\u0026#39;d do to anyone but Tabitha. I threw my arms around Momo, \u0026#34;Thank you,\u0026#34; I whispered in her ear as clearly as I\u0026#39;m writing this now. It was the first time I said anything without stumbling that wasn\u0026#39;t directed at my sister.\n\u0026#34;Hey,\u0026#34; Momo said, \u0026#34;any time.\u0026#34; I think I held on a bit too long, because she soon started squirming. I let go but we\u0026#39;ve been nearly inseparable sense.\nI don\u0026#39;t if Momo had said something to that teacher or to the principle about him, or what happened after that day. All I know, is I was never called on again that entire year.\nSorry, I know I said this wasn\u0026#39;t going to be all about Momo. Guess I was wrong. Momo and I are just very close, so I can\u0026#39;t help but write about her a lot.\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"adventures","tags":["original","adventure","allana","rebase","momo"],"title":"RE[BASE] Allana: Hello World!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/allana_ep1/"},{"content":" Welcome!\nThis is designed to help you figure out what to do on each day of Persona 4 Golden! This is designed to give you a heads up on events happening each day, I will not be telling you what to do each and every day, instead I favor telling you what will happen and how to prepare for each day.\nI\u0026#39;ve started this kind of in the middle of my current playthrough. So I don\u0026#39;t have April included, which includes events from the first. For now I\u0026#39;ll be pulling from things I\u0026#39;ve read and my own memory, but the good news is, the first dungeon and the story to that point is pretty straightforward. Nevertheless I will be covering that when I can.\nThe hot and steamy bathhouse! There is something just a little odd and unexpected about Kanji Tatsumi. On the third day after rescuing Yukiko, Kanji appears on the Midnight Channel. The first time the party sees this they aren\u0026#39;t entirely sure who it is, but it becomes clear after the second viewing. Sadly, they cannot confront Kanji before he is kidnaped. He appears once more in a steamy bathhouse, only he seems a little different.\n5/20 - 5/23 Kanji disappears around the 20th of May (5/20). The 20th is a Thursday. Even before he disappears, Dojima-san tells you to keep an eye out for Adachi in Junes. Believe it or not this is a clue, though its not really Adachi your looking for, but I digress.\nYou see, when Kanji disappears, you will head over to the TV world where your shocked to find that Teddy is having difficulty locating Kanji. To help him out, you need to learn more about the delinquent. To do so you need to find the young man you saw him speaking to just before he was kidnaped. Remember how I said Junes was a clue, well this young man can actually be found in Junes, but not every day. In fact, he is only there Tues., Thurs., and Sat. You need to find him, speak with him, then find Kanji\u0026#39;s mom and speak to her, but there\u0026#39;s a bit of a trick to this. She will only appear after you speak to the young man, and never on the same day you speak to him. So you have to time it right.\nAfter speaking to the young man, go about your day, maybe go to work or do whatever you want that day, keep in mind that your friends, and a few others won\u0026#39;t be available yet. On the next day, go to the textile shop. Kanji\u0026#39;s mom should be right outside, if she isn\u0026#39;t, go about your day as you normally would, if she is, speak to her first. Finally, on the next Tues., Thurs., or Sat. Find the young man and speak with him again. He\u0026#39;ll give you the clue you need to hand over to Teddy. You can hop into the TV right away to hand over the clue and gain access to the bathhouse, or wait until it is most convenient. You should have access to your friends and other social links once you have the clue, but I shared it with Teddy right away, so I\u0026#39;m not sure.\n5/24 - 6/3 If you do the above quickly you may have a bit more time. If your slower you may not have as much time. This is the date I started and should be a good amount of time to get this dungeon done and dusted. I\u0026#39;m still on this date.\nThe first two floors are fairly easy. Keep in mind that each floor is generated randomly by the game, just like with the previous dungeon. There will be chests to open and some fairly easy shadows to beat. There is a cutscene where the party gets their first glimpse of Kanji\u0026#39;s shadow, but this all that is of note. On my playthrough on easy I was easily able to reach this floor in one afternoon. As with all dungeons, mind your time and watch your party.\nAfter a few days I came back and got up to floor seven. On this floor you will encounter a sub boss. He isn\u0026#39;t too difficult. I does appear to have an instant kill skill, and my use it against your female party members. Best to have some revival beads on you. He does nullify light-based skills, and I was not able to find a weakness, though darkness wasn\u0026#39;t tested. I\u0026#39;ll put the output of his analysis below\nName Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Light Dark Daring Gigas 24 Strength 928 100 Nul ? After reaching the 10th floor you will encounter Kanji and his shadow. Prepare for a fight! My strategy, however, was to get to the last floor by 6/3 that allowed me to take on these boss\u0026#39;s with full HP/SP. The results of the analysis are below. Keep in mind that these guys appear to target female party members more, have opposing weaknesses, and can block each other\u0026#39;s weaknesses. This makes for a challenging fight even on lower difficulties. The fight is far from impossible especially for a fully rested party.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Kanji ? Emperor ? ? - - Dr - Null Null Tough Guy ? Emperor ? ? Wk Null - Str Null Null Nice Guy ? Emperor ? ? Null Wk - Str Null Null One final note: These bosses can cast poison and rage on the whole party. In my playthrough rage seemed to effect the female party members while males were less effected. Poison appeared to work the opposite. I\u0026#39;ll update this when I have a chance to test it in other playthroughs\n5/25 On this date you will get a cutscene before school introducing you to a new job, the Tutor job. This is a job that you can go to at night, tues., thurs., and sat. it pays very well (10,000 yen per day), but requires high understanding.\nMarie is also available to go out this day.\n5/26 There is a quiz in class today. This is a fairly easy question as long as you are paying attention. If you want to skip the dialog, however, the answer is, \u0026#34;attendance logs\u0026#34;.\n5/28 The mail order show starts. You can order things from the TV in your room. Watch for deals on Sun., Mon., and Tues.\n5/30 There is another lecture on this day, but there is no quiz and it does not affect what is available for you to do this day.\n6/1 Rain sets in today. This is the game\u0026#39;s warning that you will need to hurry and save Kanji. Marie is available this day as well. Also, it is good to remember that some part-time jobs and clubs cannot be done on rainy days.\n6/4 This is it! This is your last day to save Kanji.\n6/5 Kanji returns! You will now have a few cutscenes to go through where the party will welcome Kanji to their group and discuss the case thus far. Congratulations on finishing the bathhouse!\n6/6 A lot is about to happen and yet hardly anything happens. Here\u0026#39;s what I mean. Over the next several days nothing happens on the midnight channel and nothing new happens in the TV world, however, a lot of events and story notes will take place. At the moment the party will just discuss changes to the killer\u0026#39;s MO and other notes about the case to this date.\n6/8 There is a lecture today. There will be a question, the answer to which is \u0026#34;balance beam\u0026#34;. After the lecture you will begin discussing getting a motorcycle license.\n6/9 You\u0026#39;ll get your license today and you are gifted a scooter. You can practice riding it and unlock other areas to travel from doing so.\n6/13 This is the first day of summer, yay?\n6/15 There is a quiz this day too, the answer is \u0026#34;cheerfulness in a group\u0026#34;. You will have a pick up (as in pickup a girl) contest after school today.\n6/16 The girls go shopping to prepare for the school camp out.\n6/17 - 6/18 Camp out day one, it should be noted none of your usual ways of spending time will be available, its all story at cutscenes, just sit back and let the game hold your hands for a bit\n6/20 Rise makes a TV announcement. The party suspects she might be the next victim. There is a quiz this day to, the answer is \u0026#34;Meiji\u0026#34;. There is a special boss in the bathhouse. Things are about to shift, so this may be your last chance to take care of it.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Intolerant Officer ? Emperor ? ? - - Wk ? Null Null Marukyu Striptease Rise Kujikawa is an idol from the small town of Inaba, where the story is taking place. As an idol, Rise has to conform to a certain personality archetype, but is actually quite different from how she appears on TV. As a result, she is struggling with her true self and the \u0026#34;manufactured personality\u0026#34; she has as an idol.\n6/21 - 6/23 After the party begin to suspect that Rise may be the next target, she begins to appear on the Midnight Channel. Unlike before, they will immediately identify her. Like before, they will not be able to save her, so it will be off to the TV for you.\n6/24 Like with Kanji, Teddy has difficulty pinpointing Rise in the TV world even after her program begins on the Midnight Channel. He asks you to go get more information about her. You need to ask around town to find out more about Rise. You can start with either the tofu shop she works at where the old lady tells you about the paparazzo hanging around or you can start at the school where you can speak to a chubby man at Practice Building 2F who tells you a bit more about Rise and also advises you to speak with someone in the media. Either way you will eventually have to speak to both of them. Once you do, you will be advise to look for paparazzi at the flood plain. You won\u0026#39;t find any yet, but the \u0026#34;kind man\u0026#34; there will advise you to look tomorrow.\n6/25 Now you can head back to the flood plain and find the \u0026#34;photographer\u0026#34; (if you don\u0026#39;t want to/can\u0026#39;t do this today, note that the \u0026#34;photographer\u0026#34; is only there Tues., Thurs., and Sat.). Give the man two pieces of info about Rise, basically all options except that she is in town. With this, he gives you enough information that Teddy should be able to pinpoint Rise. Take this information back to the TV to unlock the dungeon.\n6/26 - 7/9 You have a couple of weeks to save Rise from her shadow. Marukyu Striptease, like the previous two dungeons is roughly 10 floors with a final fight on the next floor after that. There are many different types of shadows and they will begin introducing shadows that nullify or even repel certain elemental attacks. Stay on your toes. Keep a full and diverse party. You can decide what role the main character plays, but I kept him as my Lightning, Dark, and Light damage dealer. Also relay on the analysis option to keep everything sraight. You don\u0026#39;t want to accidently use a repelling element. At about 7F you will be met with a sub-boss. This fight shouldn\u0026#39;t be too difficult, but a fresh party would be helpful as it will likely start with stagnant air (to increase suseptibility for ailments) and will attempt to poison your party. Here are its full stats as reported by analysis after scanning for weaknesses and strengths.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Amorous Snake 33 Lovers 1012 148 - - - - Null Null After this fight the floor mazes will start to get a bit more complicated, and you\u0026#39;ll be dealing with some more difficult shadows. Be very careful as one of them will repel dark, if you aren\u0026#39;t careful you could end up instant KOing yourself (leading to an instant game over). After completing ten floors, I suggest leaving and coming back another day so you are well rested for a two part fight.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Rise ? Lovers ? ? - - - - Null Null Shadow Rise has no weaknesses, but is more than capable of taking advantage of your weaknesses. She is able to use any basic elemental attack. I did not see evidence of light or dark attacks. At a certain point in the fight she will begin to analyze you (yeah I didn\u0026#39;t see this coming at all). When this happens you will be unable to hit her. Just keep guarding for a few more turns to trigger dialog and a surprise twist.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Teddie ? Moon ? ? - Dr - - Null Null It is after the twist that the real fight begins. Shadow Rise, was pretty easy actually, now its time for Shadow Teddie! This will be a real fight. Like Shadow Rise, Teddie has no weaknesses. He will also attempt to lower your party\u0026#39;s defenses right away and inflict other ailments. Eventually he will begin charging attacks. At these points, make sure all party members are guarding when the message \u0026#34;Shadow Teddie is charging up\u0026#34; is displayed. You will block the attack fully. Careful though! Shadow Teddie will attempt to inflict dizzy on a party member, or two, before charging up.\n7/4 There is a lecture and a pop quiz today. The answer to the question is \u0026#34;Pascal\u0026#34;\n7/7 Another lecture and quiz this day. The answer to the question is \u0026#34;The Deceleration of Independence\u0026#34;\n7/10 So Teddie joins the party in a new capacity and new form (yeah that was also surprising) and our super cute idol Rise will join the party. She replaces Teddie as your analyst, however, so don\u0026#39;t expect her to be fighting alongside you. Your homeroom teacher was murdered last night and his story appears today on the news.\n7/11 You get a new homeroom teacher. Brace yourself for that, by the way, she isn\u0026#39;t exactly any better than your last. Also, brace yourself for a barrage of cutscenes as everyone discusses the case so far.\n7/12 Nothing much happens now. Take a nice rest! Finals start next week!\n7/13 - 7/16 To help you prepare for next week\u0026#39;s finals, you will have a series of pop quizzes. The answers are relatively easy though if you pay attention in class, you do pay attention, don\u0026#39;t you? Well, since this isn\u0026#39;t a real school, I guess I can let you look at my answers:\n7/13: sphenopalatine gangloinueralgia 7/14: Kuukai 7/15: the equator 7/16: no mustache Enjoy your weekend! Note: Marie is available 7/13 as well\n7/19 - 7/23 Finals week is here. Again, just because this is a game and not a real class, I\u0026#39;ll let you look at my notes, but you really should just be paying attention in class.\nDay 1, Quiz 1: cheerfulness in a group Day 1, Quiz 2: balance beam Day 2, Quiz 1: Âøú Day 2, Quiz 2: Meiji Day 3, Quiz 1: king of hearts Day 3, Quiz 2: pascal Day 4, Quiz 1: pis pis river Day 4, Quiz 3: deceleration of independence 7/23 You will meet to discuss the case a bit more. Pick \u0026#34;formaldehyde\u0026#34; when asked. The Lovers arcana is opened to you!\n7/25 You will get your test results today. How did you do? I gave you all the answers, so you should have done well üòù\n7/26 - 7/27 Time for a new midnight TV, nothing else happens. Just sit back and enjoy the story. In fact you can sit back for two days! You will meet the next day to try and figure out who the boy is. Actually you probably should sit around the second day. You should go talk to Kanji real quick on the second day you\u0026#39;ll need to do this if you want to open the next dungeon quickly.\nVoid Quest Have you found the culprit at last? Only one way to find out! Back into the TV with you! Keep in mind that summer vacation officially started 7/28, sorry I forgot to tell you. This means you will not have to worry about school or club activities. It also means those social links are blocked from progression at this time.\n7/28 - 7/29 If you couldn\u0026#39;t or didn\u0026#39;t talk to Kanji, you should be able to do so now, also take his suggestion and talk to Doujima, though it doesn\u0026#39;t seem helpful, you can actually use this to get some info out of Adachi, but not on the first day as he is probably not available. Better wait until the second, you\u0026#39;ll learn from Adachi that the boy was a part-timer at one of the shops. In fact, it was Souzai Daigaku in the north section of the shopping district (the steak place). Once you talk to the owner there, you should see a boy with blonde hair and a school bag hanging around the tofu shop. You\u0026#39;ll get a yearbook photo of the culprit from him. This will be all Rise needs to track him down. If, for some reason, he does not appear, the boy will appear again on 8/1, make sure you have completed all the steps above, before that time. I don\u0026#39;t know when he\u0026#39;ll show up again, but he does not show up on every day.\n7/29 - 8/12 This dungeon is modeled after an old point-and-click-adventure game, or maybe an 8-bit RPG brought into a 3-D world, one of those two. If you have been leveling diligently, the shadows here will probably be pretty easy. Just, as always, watch your HP and SP and pace yourself. You have about two weeks to complete this dungeon. Chapter 3 and Chapter 7 will probably confuse you. Chapter three looks like a dead end, but you will be teleported around if you get close to some of the walls. Just be mindful of where you\u0026#39;ve been and how you got there to avoid backtracking and you should make it to the stairs. Chapter 7 will try to confuse you by moving your move direction and camera around on you. Just gotta power through that one, eventually you\u0026#39;ll get to the stairs. There are no sub-bosses in this dungeon, but there is a fairly interesting, and tricky boss fight!\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Mitsuo the Hero ? ? ??? ??? - - - - Null Null Shadow Mitsuo ? ? ??? ??? - - - - Null Null This dungeon is fashioned after an old-school RPG. At the beginning of this fight, Mitsuo will start by building his character. This creates the boxy shell known as Mitsuo the Hero. Mitsuo the Hero uses powerful attacks straight out of an RPG, including an old-style UI for you to enjoy. You must destroy this shell before you can hurt Shadow Mitsuo himself. Keep in mind Shadow Mitsuo a wall during the fight and will attack with the Ma-spell that matches it. Be mindful of your party\u0026#39;s weaknesses and try to counter when you can. He will also attempt to rebuild his character, but you will have some warning when this is about to happen. Aside from being mindful of your weaknesses, there isn\u0026#39;t much to this fight and you should not have too much difficulty winning.\n8/3 Marie will be available for you to have a good time with üòú\n8/7 Marie is now available again. Keep in mind that you are on summer break now. You normal activities will not be available, but you will have much more free time for some of your other S-Links, including Marie.\n8/12 This is your last change to confront Mitsuo. If you haven\u0026#39;t reached chapter 10 in the dungeon by now, you must do so now, at all costs!\n8/13 Marie is also available today. Your evening, however, will be spent with a lively \u0026#34;victory\u0026#34; dinner with Doujima, Nanako, and Adachi.\n8/15-8/19 You will be given the opportunity to work at Junes to help Yosuke out. This will earn you 40,000 yen (by the way you\u0026#39;ll also get 40,000 for Doujima if you talk to him at the right moment before this day). It will also net you some S-Link points for Chie and Yosuke. However, this all does come with a price. That is you will skip the entire week, so you won\u0026#39;t be able to do anything else. It is a good way to fast track some boring days though. Its up to you if its worth it or not.\n8/20 This is a story telling day. You\u0026#39;ll attend the first day of the summer festival with friends. Enjoy the cutscenes!\n8/21 You can choose to spend your evening with another summer festival day, this time with your favorite girl! This will skip the whole day though.\n8/23 You can choose to have a beach day today. Choosing this will give you a pretty funny cutscene that you have to watch at least once, but it will skip the whole day until evening. If you have anything you need to do today for any reason, maybe skip the beach for now. The evening will present another option for you. You will be able to help Nanako with her homework. This will build her S-Link rank and also those of a few of your classmates who will stop by to help. Its worth it to help you build those S-Links, but will also take up a few evenings, not just this one.\n8/24 You remember that you have summer assignment to work on. You can choose to spend your daytime hours at your desk working on homework. This is a good way of raising your knowledge, but if you are already fairly high, than you might want to skip one or more of these. At least you have the option. Also, remember, if you decided to help Nanako your evenings will be spent with her (you have no choice after the first one), so you won\u0026#39;t be able to do anything else in the evenings.\n8/29 This is the last day to finish your summer assignments. The game is going to force you to spend the daytime hours finishing them up. If you chose to help Nanako you will spend your evening with her, so this day will probably be a wash. Fortunately, it also happens to be the last day you\u0026#39;ll need to help Nanako.\n8/30 - 8/31 Prepare yourself for a lot of story scenes. First, you\u0026#39;ll have the fireworks festival, this will take all of the first day. Second, you will have some watermelon to eat with Nanako and your friends. This takes the daylight hours of the second day.\n9/1 School is bake in session! Welcome to your second term! Naoto, the boy detective will also come to school for the next few days, including the school trip. You\u0026#39;ll also spend your after school hours talking with Naoto over recent events, so more story!\n9/3 - 9/6 Nothing of particular note here. You\u0026#39;re finally free to do almost whatever you want. On the first day Marie will be available to work on her S-Link. You will receive a quiz on the second to last day in this stretch. The answer is Brisk. The last day here will inform you of a powerful new shadow in the game that you can optionally fight!\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Escapist Soldier ? Justice ??? ??? - - - - Null Null Watch out for elemental skills! Will also cast \u0026#34;Stagnant Air\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Mudon\u0026#34;. Remember, \u0026#34;Mudon\u0026#34; is an instant KO dark skill, if this hits the party leader, it will be a game over. It is best to make sure your party leader, if not the entire party, is immune to dark.\n9/7-9/11 You will have after school on 9/7 to yourself, but your evening will be taken up by getting ready for the school trip. The school trip itself lasts from 9/8-9/10 and is all story, so just sit back and relax again. You will be home by 9/11, and Marie will be available again.\n9/12 A special report will be shown on TV. This report talks about the case and, most importantly, about Naoto. It will take away your evening though, so plan accordingly.\n9/14 The rain lasts well into the night today. You will use this opportunity to watch the midnight channel. If you were paying real close attention you might not be surprised when a faint image appears on the TV. After all even Naoto wasn\u0026#39;t entirely convinced that the real killer was caught.\n9/15 Time to discuss what everyone saw on the Midnight Channel after school. You\u0026#39;ll also get the game\u0026#39;s first back-to-back midnight channels and discovered that Naoto has gotten themselves thrown into the TV.\nSecret Laboratory 9/16 Time to talk about the more clear transmission everyone got to see. Even though you and everyone else is aware of who is in the other world, Rise still has a bit of trouble discovering where they are. You\u0026#39;ll have to look for clues. Fortunately I\u0026#39;ll tell you the steps you need to take to find the clues you need. First you will need to head back to school. There is someone on the first floor, between classes 1-1 and 1-2 that heard a rumor about another student which had something of Naoto\u0026#39;s. That student was spotted near the science labs, and, fortunately, is still there. This girl will tell you that she heard Naoto yelling and a police officer. Looks like you\u0026#39;ll have to talk to one. Now there is currently one in the north end of the shopping district, but he won\u0026#39;t talk to you. You need a reason for him to listen. Chie will give you an idea. Now I didn\u0026#39;t know about this step on this day, so I talked to her on 9/17, but you should be able to talk to her today and then the first officer will give you your first clue, but I\u0026#39;ll give you the events as I did them. You will also learn that another officer appears on the south end of the shopping district Tues, Thurs, and Sat, if you speak to the right NPC in the north end. They\u0026#39;re near the police officer.\n9/17 There\u0026#39;s a quiz today. The answer is 40 minutes. Once school is out, head over to the flood plains (if you didn\u0026#39;t/couldn\u0026#39;t talk to Chie yesterday) and find Chie. She tells you what to say when you talk to the polices officers. Now you can find the officer in the south end of the shopping district. If you were able to talk to Chie already you can head directly to this officer and get your second clue. If you were not able to talk to her this is only your first clue. You need two clues to present to Rise before you can go looking for Naoto.\n9/18 I\u0026#39;m going to put what you need to do to get into the next dungeon here, just note it seems its possible to do this in a different order and maybe get in a day earlier. If you only have one clue, find the other officer in the north end of the shopping district again and talk to him to get the second clue. Now head back to Junes and report to Rise. Tell her that Naoto is tired of being treated like a child and obsessed with this case. That\u0026#39;ll be enough for you to start your exploration of the Secret Lab!\n9/17-10/05 This dungeon is not as straightforward as the others, but doesn\u0026#39;t present the same kind of challenge as the Void Quest. When you get to around B4F, yes in this dungeon your go downstairs instead of up, but that\u0026#39;s not the real twist, you will come across a locked door. unfortunately something you need is behind that door. You\u0026#39;ll have to go down a few more floors before you find a chest with an ID Card. Likely, this floor will also have a locked door but this ID Card doesn\u0026#39;t unlock that door. You\u0026#39;ll have to go back to the first locked door and use this item to open it to get access to a sub-boss which will have the key you need to open the second door. Yeah it\u0026#39;s really that confusing.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Dominating Machine 53 Justice 3070 300 - - - - Null Null This is not a particularly difficult fight. It will buff its attack, this is usually an indicator that he will perform Herculean Strike, which is a power physical attack. I was able to freeze it up by debuffing attack after its buff. Do this a few times and follow up with your most powerful attacks and the fight should be over with out you taking much damage.\nOnce you have the second key and take it to the second door you\u0026#39;ll be able to proceed again. You\u0026#39;ll find Naoto on B9F. Enjoy learned a bit more about them before you fight their shadow.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Naoto ?? Justice ???? ??? - - - - Null Null Naoto doesn\u0026#39;t really fight fair. As seems to be the norm with boss fights now, they have no weakness to speak of, but will nullify your party\u0026#39;s resistances as well. Furthermore, while they also don\u0026#39;t seem to have any light/dark skills, they do still have one instant kill skill. You\u0026#39;ll want to make sure some of your party are able to survive a death blow (usually acquired at high enough S-Rank). When their HP gets low, they will start using Mute Ray which casts silence and steals both HP and SP from a single target. This is a difficult fight, but, if you focus on your strongest party and keep everyone\u0026#39;s HP high you should be able to win. Also watch when everyone is buffed/debuffed and plan you attacks just right for the best damage possible.\n9/20 - 9/28 Not much happens during this time. Its the perfect chance to work on S-Links and explore the Secret Lab. 9/20 does have a quiz in PE, the answer is: nonagenarian. There is a lecture on 9/24. but no quiz. 9/28 also has a lecture and quiz, the answer is: Throat.\n10/02 You can choose to hang out with the girls today. You don\u0026#39;t have to, but you do get a few fun scenes while you are out shopping with them. Kanji even joins you, though Yosuke seems to have been smart enough not to show. If you do choose this, you will gain S-Link for all the girls and Kanji. Might help you with the S-Rank.\n10/03 - 10/05 Other than 10/05 being the last day to save Naoto, not much happens during these three days. There are quizzes though. Here are the answers in order, starting with 10/04 as 10/03 is just a lecture: tug-of-war, and right edge.\nCongrats! You have made it through the first half of the year and also about the first half of the game. There is a lot more to do though, but this walkthrough is getting long enough so I\u0026#39;m splitting it up. See you in the next part.\n","description":"A walkthrough for the first half of Persona 4 Golden","id":2,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","walkthrough","p4g","persona"],"title":"Walkthrough (May thru Sep)","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkpt1/"},{"content":" The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I\u0026#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr. If you can\u0026#39;t get a spot I suggest having someone kill Guardian Masters for you. This is still fairly fast and there are several spots this can be done at. This is my favorite way to level. It isn\u0026#39;t as fast or exciting as FM, but it does the trick.\nIf this isn\u0026#39;t an option for you, or you\u0026#39;d rather take your time and experience the various areas of the game, then there are quests you can do at this level. All the regular quests are fairly easy and fast up to about level 30. In fact, in my opinion, this is the most fun way to level especially if you have a friend or two to level babies with. Below are a few repeatables you can do together to make things faster, especially after level 30, if you want üòâ\nRepeatable Quests (level 1-39) Despicable Little Ones - Little Hobs - Level 10 The Mini Greenky - Mini Greenkies - Level 11 Disease Carriers - Ratman - Level 12 Medical Herbs - Ratman with Herb Leaf - Level 12 Working for Karl - Broken Blade from Hooligan Phinoflies with Copper Ore (NQ and LQ) - Level 12 Clam Chowder - Boogy - Level 13 The Apple Thieves 2 - Boogy with Boogie\u0026#39;s egg from them - Level 13 - Available after completeting The Apple Thieves 1 Joker Kebings 2 - Joker Kebing - Level 18 - Available after completing Joker Kebings 1 Speedy Boogy 2 - Speedy Boogy - Level 18 - Available after completing Speedy Boogy 1 Herb Plant Set 2 - Herb Leaf, Herb Stem, and Herb Root (from gathering herbs) - Level 25 - Available after Herb Plant Set 1 Insomnia 2 - Glow Wolf - Level 25 - Available after completing Insomnia 1 Forzen Ice Cream 2 - Ice Vivi with Soft Ice Bits from them - Level 28 - Available after Frozen Ice Cream 1 The Oppression of Ghosts - Ghosts - Level 37 Harvest 2 - Hoes from Hobs - Level 38 - Available after completing Harvest 1 Bone Imp Bags 3 - Bone Imp Bags from Bone Imps - Level 39 - Available after completing Bone Imp bags 2 What to do at level 40? Those were not all the repeatable quests and you probably won\u0026#39;t need to complete a majority of them to reach level 40. For more information on quests you can visit the Fiesta Wiki. This will also help you complete pre-requisite quests for some of the reps above. Once your baby hits level 40 it is time for the Tower of Iyzel. Just because they are level 40, however, doesn\u0026#39;t mean that can beat the tower on their own. If you have a few friends, this could be pretty easy, but, if not, I should have an runner that can help you. Head to Roumen, visit Templar Maria and pick up all the quests that mention the tower than find a runner or get your party together and head to Forest of Mist to find the tower itself. With all the quests picked up, one run should get you to level 41 or 42.

This is designed to give you a heads up on events happening each day, I will not be telling you what to do each and every day, instead I favor telling you what will happen and how to prepare for each day.\nI\u0026#39;ve started this kind of in the middle of my current playthrough. So I don\u0026#39;t have April included, which includes events from the first. For now I\u0026#39;ll be pulling from things I\u0026#39;ve read and my own memory, but the good news is, the first dungeon and the story to that point is pretty straightforward. Nevertheless I will be covering that when I can.\nThis part is current a work in progress. I am building this as I playthrough the story myself. This is so I can give you a fresh head up on how things will go.\nThe Next Victim 10/06 - 10/10 This is a series of story scenes that will take your after school time. It will start with discussing with Naoto what happened when they were kidnapped. They know quite a lot of details, but you will still have wait for another victim to come forward to investigate further. After getting Naoto-kun\u0026#39;s reports, you will be helping Yosuke and Rise with a concert. The concert is on 10/10, but you\u0026#39;ll spend a few days preparing. Just enjoy the scenes. The event even has a nice animated scene. There is one quiz during these day, on 10/08. The answer is pretty obvious, but I\u0026#39;ll tell you anyway, it\u0026#39;s: chicken. It should be noted that your evenings are still free, so use this time to finish up Nanako\u0026#39;s S-Link or spend time with everyone in the evening.\n10/11 Your after school hours are still not yours. You agree to study with everyone. Naoto will likely ask you to go into the TV when you get back home, but that\u0026#39;ll have to wait until tomorrow. Good news is, this means you\u0026#39;ll be free to do what you want tomorrow. There is a quiz today too, the answer is: glass jars.\n10/12 A nice Halloween-themed quiz. The answer is: turnips (imagine carving those!). You\u0026#39;ll be notified that a new strong shadow has appeared in the lab. Now is a good time to go back if you don\u0026#39;t have anything else to do.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Extreme Vessel ?? Fortune ???? ??? - - - Wk Null Null 10/13 Everything is basically back to your normal rhythm. One more quiz, they\u0026#39;ll be ramping up since your exams are coming up again. The answer is: ojisan.\n10/14 - 10/20 With exception of 10/16, which is a Sunday, you will spend the next few days in school answering questions on your midterm exams. You are normally free in the evening, but may not be free during the after school hours. As such, it is a good idea to have fought the above special boss before this date. You could have 10/16. but you will be asked to join a study group, so, if you haven\u0026#39;t fought the boss by now, it will be a toss up between enhancing S-Ranks and completing the boss. There will be sometime after exams, however. I\u0026#39;m not going to give you the questions on your exams as the questions and answers can\u0026#39;t co-exist in the same area without endangering all of humanity. I will give you the answers though:\nDay Q1 Answer Q2 Answer 1 Throat The Right edge 2 40 Minutes All of the above 3 Black and White Bears Ostrich 4 ??* Glass Jars 5 Fall Plan Resin (* Day 4/Q1 I got wrong in this playthrough, you\u0026#39;ll still get top marks for this, but I can only say Wasan Shoujo is not the right answer)\nThe last day has no questions. You\u0026#39;ll be given a general sense of how you feel you did and the day will end. Your exams on now over, hope you did well. You will receive a mysterious letter, which gives you something to talk about with your friends in the morning, but that is it.\n10/22 You will be given an opportunity to vote for an activity for your class to host during the culture festival this weekend. As this is the first time I played this far, I\u0026#39;m not sure if your choice actually matters. To be funny, I just chose the \u0026#34;group date cafe\u0026#34; let me know if you picked something different and how that turned out!\n10/24 You get your test results today. If you answered all the questions with the answers I gave you, then you\u0026#39;ll get top marks and all of your school friends will be impressed. This will increase all their S-Ranks.\n10/27 - 10/28 The culture festival will be starting at the end of this week, and guess which class completely forgot about it? Yeah, yours! So, now you\u0026#39;ll be spending a few days, including after school hours, preparing for the culture festival. If you have anything you want to get done in the TV do it before now, or you\u0026#39;ll have to wait until next week.\n10/29 - 10/30 The culture festival itself. This is just a compilation of some really fun scenes. You will lose more time and you\u0026#39;ll want to be prepared for a long set of cutscenes. There will not be many opportunities to save once the culture festival starts. In fact, your next chance will be after the hot springs visit on 10/30. Make sure you block out plenty of time to get through these scenes!\n10/31 You\u0026#39;ll get an extra day off. You can save and do whatever, but, if you want everyone\u0026#39;s Halloween costumes, you\u0026#39;re going to have to help Yosuke out and Junes. This whole thing is a wash and all you get are the outfits though, so its up to you.\n11/01 Nothing of note really, just a quiz, the answer is: geometric shapes\n11/03 You\u0026#39;ll get an extra day off, just don\u0026#39;t count on school activities this day.\n11/04 Just another quiz, the answer is: Cuckoo\n","description":"A walkthrough for the second half of Persona 4 Golden","id":4,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","walkthrough","p4g","persona","wip"],"title":"Walkthrough (Oct onward)","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkpt2/"},{"content":" This is an original story. The story is written in first person, please note that the thoughts and feelings expressed in this story are those of the character, Allana, and not those of the author, Yayoi. Thank you!\nOrigin of Quest Okay, so now you are all very familiar with my interesting classmate and best friend, Momo, but I didn\u0026#39;t really explain too much about myself or my sister. You probably have one big question in particular. Well, maybe I can answer that one first. I\u0026#39;m shy right, you should\u0026#39;ve got that from the other post, but I like MMORPGs which are massively multiplayer, meaning lots of people, so how exactly does that work? Well, I\u0026#39;m not exactly sure, but I can tell you how I started playing those kinds of games.\nFirst I should probably mention, MMORPGs aren\u0026#39;t the only games I play. In fact, they are far from the first games I played. That would be FantasyQuest, the original one, before they were even numbered and way before FantasyQuest Online. In fact, I always loved the stories JRPGs told and the characters and the boss fights and strategy and just everything about them. I\u0026#39;m pretty sure my sister used that against me, to be honest. Not that I mind now, but this is how she introduced me to MMORPGs.\nIt was two years ago. I came home after my fairly usual school day. It wasn\u0026#39;t a particularly good day, or a really bad day, it was just a day. I got out of my school clothes and into something more comfortable. By this time I was re-gifted our old Super Fairchild console and one of the old living room TVs, both had been set up across from my bed. How I play games is a little different now, but back then I would just sit, cross-legged, on the edge of my bed, controller in hand and the TV remove right next to me.\nSo, I was just sitting there, completely sucked into the world of FantasyQuest III (the last one released for the SFC and the latest one I could play). I heard my door open as I was in the middle of a boss fight. Someone sat on my bed behind me, but I was too focused on the boss to pay much attention. To her credit, my sister waited through two failed attempts to beat the boss, before she tapped my shoulder. As I had just won the difficult boss, I paused the game for her and looked behind me. She wasn\u0026#39;t just sitting on my bed, she was also holding something. It was her laptop. \u0026#34;I wanted to show you something,\u0026#34; she said.\nQuest Start I had no idea what to expect. My sister and I had played a few casual games together. In fact, we stilled played Drive City Revolution and Cart Racer Xtreme on the newer Play Box in the living room from time-to-time, but I didn\u0026#39;t really see her as much of a gamer. To be honest, I thought she was only playing those games as an excuse to hang out with me because I was usually not far from a game of some kind. I\u0026#39;m still not sure I was entirely wrong, but soon I heard a familiar song playing. If fact, it was a song I just heard only with a full orchestra. \u0026#34;FantasyQuest!?\u0026#34; I questioned.\nMy sister turned her laptop screen toward me. I saw a familiar logo along with the much fuller and richer opening theme song, and awesome fully 3D background and a couple of boxes that replaced the typical press \u0026#39;start\u0026#39; to begin your quest that always appeared below the logo even on the demo copy of FantasyQuest X I saw in stores. In fact, there was also something written under the FantasyQuest logo, which was styled eerily similar to the original logo. \u0026#34;FantasyQuest Online,\u0026#34; my sister corrected just as I read the new word.\nIt hadn\u0026#39;t donned on me that this was a FantasyQuest game that was running on a laptop and not a console until after Tabitha said that. \u0026#34;Wait? FantasyQuest on PC?\u0026#34; I asked.\n\u0026#34;Yep, it\u0026#39;s an MMO,\u0026#34; my sister explained as if that made a difference. Oh, my poor sister, even the original Dream Station had a modem, but I guess we never owned that console or that addon so I suppose I could let that go.\n\u0026#34;MMO?\u0026#34; I asked. Up until this point I was fairly familiar with games, but not the online scene or really even the internet, so those letters didn\u0026#39;t mean anything to me yet.\n\u0026#34;Well, MMORPG, it means a massively multiplayer online role-playing game,\u0026#34; Tabitha added.\n\u0026#34;That sounds,\u0026#34; I began. At first it sounded cool, a new FantasyQuest with new quests and I could do them with people. Then those last two words stuck around in my head and I was suddenly feeling anxious. \u0026#34;Scary.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;No,\u0026#34; Tabitha replied, \u0026#34;its fun. I already started a character and I really enjoy it. I\u0026#39;m level 30 already and I just got the game last night. Plus I bet we could even run it on the living room PC. The requirements seem kind of low.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;But, what about all the people?\u0026#34; I questioned.\n\u0026#34;I told you, I\u0026#39;m level 30, I can just carry you for a bit. You won\u0026#39;t even need a party. We\u0026#39;ll just play together, just the two of us,\u0026#34; My sister assured, \u0026#34;but, if you\u0026#39;re up for it, I have made a few friends. I could introduce you. All the talking is over text chats so you don\u0026#39;t have to worry about stumbling. No one even notices if you reply super late.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know,\u0026#34; I said.\n\u0026#34;Tell you what, we\u0026#39;ll just get a character set up for you tonight. If you play you play, if you don\u0026#39;t, that\u0026#39;s fine, you can go back to FantasyQuest III.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay,\u0026#34; I agreed. Didn\u0026#39;t seem like it would hurt much. Spoiler, my FantasyQuest III game stayed paused well passed dinner.\nQuest Complete! Welcome, adventurer, to the world of Gaia. A world of magic. A world of might. A world of wonder. In the fifth age men, elves, and fairies band together to protect the World Crystal, I giant mineral structure said to be the origin of all life, however, there are those that desire only destruction.\nAfter Tabitha opened a browser and walked me through the process of creating an account. I used it to log into the game where I was greeted by the introductory scene ripped straight from FantasyQuest and FantasyQuest II. There was only one difference. At the end of those two scenes, the player is taken straight to an inn and introduced to the main character. In this game, it said and so our story begins... and brought me to an entirely unfamiliar screen. \u0026#34;This is where you pick a class,\u0026#34; my sister explained.\nI had remembered the classes from the website. Each class were based off staples from past FatasyQuest games. I spent more than a few minutes trying to decide between two ranged classes, gunner and archer. My sister wasn\u0026#39;t much help either. She said that both were ranged DPS, as if that meant something to me, and played very similarly. She said archer dealt more damage over time while gunners had higher critical rates, which was something I sort of understood from the other games. In the end I picked a gunner. I made her female, called her Artemis and probably spent way too long trying to create the cutest gunner fairy anyone had ever seen. \u0026#34;A fairy?\u0026#34; Tabitha asked.\n\u0026#34;Why not?\u0026#34; I retorted.\n\u0026#34;Well, in this game, your race decides your build,\u0026#34; Tabitha said. I\u0026#39;m pretty sure she was quoting a friend or the website, but I listened any way. \u0026#34;You see you only picked your starting class, you can have more jobs and more classes as you progress through the game all they do is decide what skills, armor, and weapons you use. Of course, armor and weapons can effect your stats while you wear them, but your base stats are decided by your race so they have more to do with your base build than your class. Fairies are more mystical in nature so they make good mages and priestesses. Gunner is a physical ranged DPS, so the well-rounded human is probably the best race for that class.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Humans are ugly,\u0026#34; I said.\n\u0026#34;True,\u0026#34; Tabitha laughed. \u0026#34;Well, I\u0026#39;m sure you can make a fairy work.\u0026#34;\nBefore she had even assured me that my choice could work I had already clicked start adventure. My sister guided me as we both set on my bed, her laptop in my lap. We went through a few starter quests and I gained five levels mostly from talking. We were working on a particularly difficult quest when my sister got a text message. \u0026#34;You got this!\u0026#34; she said before leaving the room. I don\u0026#39;t know how many times I had come close to dying, but I managed to kill all the groups of monsters, which I soon learned were called mobs, that I needed.\nIt was about that time that I got a random friend request from a character named TabbyKat. I felt so anxious and was just about to decline it when I got a text from my sister. It\u0026#39;s me, it said, accept my friend request. So, I clicked accept, and soon a message popped up in chat. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m here to help,\u0026#34; it was from TabbyKat, \u0026#34;but I may have told a friend about the adorable fairy gunner my sister made, and they kind of want to see you. Is that okay? You don\u0026#39;t have to talk.\u0026#34;\nMy anxiety returned, but I didn\u0026#39;t want to say no. My sister had been very helpful and I was really enjoying the game, so I took a deep breath and typed a reply. \u0026#34;Sure,\u0026#34; I said, \u0026#34;if I don\u0026#39;t have to talk, its fine.\u0026#34;\nThat was not only when my love of MMOs started, but also when I learned that typing in a chat box was a lot easier than talking in a classroom. There were a lot of people in the game I didn\u0026#39;t know, but it wasn\u0026#39;t too bad. Most of them seemed pretty nice and everyone I met adored my character and seemed to even adore me. Finally I found a place where I felt comfortable talking and interacting with others. It was all thanks to my sister. I never found out how she had heard about FantasyQuest Online, but I was very glad she had.\n","description":"","id":5,"section":"adventures","tags":["allana","tabitha","original","adventure","rebase"],"title":"RE[BASE] Allana: First Quest","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/allana_ep2/"},{"content":" If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.\nFrom this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently. In some cases you can gain up to four levels in a less than an hour, if you can catch the right quests. For now though, it is best to exploit Tower of Iyzel to get you to 41 or 42 than you should run around completing various 40-42 level quests until you reach level 43.\nHow best to exploit repeatables from level 43-80, in Yayoi\u0026#39;s opinion There are many leveling guides available. Each guide seems to have its own way of doing things and there are a lot of arguments over what is the best way to level a character. This is simply how I like to do things. If you are in a guild academy and managed a discord invite, see if your guild has a guide and feel free to experiment.\nLevel 43-44 Complete the quest \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; This will require you to 8 Goblin Swordman and pick up 3 Goblin Swords that they drop. Once you turn in \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; you will unlock the quest \u0026#34;A Bet with Marty 2\u0026#34;. This requires you to pick up 5 Goblin Swords from Goblin Swordsman and kill 10 of those mobs. This is a repeatable to quests. After a few turn ins you should be level 44 easy. Goblin Swordman are fairly easy mobs and can be soloed by characters at this level. For clerics, however, I highly recommend you gather them while a friend kills em. Don\u0026#39;t forget to heal your friend if they need it. Level 45-49 The repeatable above will still be available, but you will also gain access to two more repeatable quests at level 44, \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;. These both require items from the same mob so they can be used at the same time. \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; requires you to get 15 Warebear\u0026#39;s Claws from Ware Bears while \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;, available after completing the first two \u0026#34;Best Broomstick\u0026#34; quests requires 15 Warebear Arm bit Hairs. Ware Bears are a bit tougher, but can probably still be soloed by all classes accept clerics.\nLevel 49-52 At level 49, you can head to Scaffold Execution Ground through the Collapsed Prison portal. Right at this portal is a mob called Mini Lips. These will drop \u0026#34;Mini Lips\u0026#39; Lips\u0026#34; if you have the quest \u0026#34;Mannequin Lips\u0026#34;. Pick up 10 of these and turn in. Repeat until you reach level 52.\nLevel 52-55 Scaffold Execution Grounds also has a rather large pack of King Colls. These will drop \u0026#34;King Donkey Teeth\u0026#34; when you have the quest \u0026#34;The Unbreakable Chisel\u0026#34;. You can pick up this quest from the quest list at level 52. This is a fairly easy and quick (especially with a killer) way to get to level 55.\nLevel 55-60 Both Collapsed Prison and Scaffold Execution Grounds have prisoners, there are more of them in large groups in Collapsed prison. As part of the Level 55 quest \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 1\u0026#34; you need to kill ten of them. Once you turn this quest in, you can pick up \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 2\u0026#34;. You now need to kill 20 prisoners for a turn in, but this is a repeatable and a fairly easy way to reach level 60.\nLevel 60 Unfortunately, many of the above quests have expired or simply don\u0026#39;t provide enough experience to help you get to level 61, so now you can do all the other quests you\u0026#39;ve neglected up until now. Have fun üòù!\nLevel 61-70 The zombie crystal rep in Crystal Cave is the quickest way to clear these three levels. It does have a few prequests though, and will require a party. I should have a CC runner to help you though.\nSecond Tower 1 Second Tower 2 What I do? Reward for Dark Crystal 3 (this is the repeatable) Level 65-67 Greenkies repeat is the easiest way to clear this two levels. Do get you need to clear \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 1\u0026#34;. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 2\u0026#34;. Crystal Cave is, however, still available!\nLevel 69-70 Do the level 6x quests now. Alternatively there is also the mud rep. It is much easier to do this rep now than it was when I first came back and many guides still omit it. Truthfully, I would only use it if I need a few more exp to get to 70, but its always there if you need it. It is called \u0026#34;Hair Remover\u0026#34; and is available at level 68, no prequests needed.\nLevel 71-74 Navar rep. Seriously fast with a good party or a good killer. You will need to complete \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 1\u0026#34;, which requires you to gather 10 Navar Merc Liscences that the Nevars will occasionally drop and turn this back into Warrior Master Marty in Elderine (did I forget to mention that regular quests can no longer be turned in at the quest list as of level 60, personally, I hate that). Once you\u0026#39;ve done that you can pick up \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 2\u0026#34; from Marty and only count the kills.\nLevel 74-75 The repeatable quest \u0026#34;Nina\u0026#39;s Revenge\u0026#34; becomes available at level 74. This is often referred to as the \u0026#34;Nox Rep\u0026#34;. It is a fairly quick rep, but I have not run it myself for a while.\nLevel 74-76 Another repeatable quest that overlaps the one above a bit is \u0026#34;Goodbye, Nightmare!\u0026#34; This is referred to as the \u0026#34;Blue Archon rep\u0026#34; and you\u0026#39;ll be killing those. This is fairly quick and easy. If you like to take a break for Nox, you can switch between the two üòâ\nLevel 77-79 Not going to lie, I used to advocate for KKP from 70-80, but that is far from the best way to level especially after 76. My new suggestion is the Lizard Knight rep. Its best to have a party with this one though. Your party should have a killer (a mage or archer that can kill groups of Lizardman Knights at once), a mob herder (someone to run around on a +1 or better mount and gather the Lizardman Knights) and at 0-3 additional party members (these will help additional items spawn and we call them droppers) all with the quest. In the right conditions you can get to 79 vary quickly. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Monster Collector 2\u0026#34;, and its available once you have turned in \u0026#34;Master Collector 1\u0026#34;\nLevel 79 Nix rep. This one is fairly quick. The quest is called \u0026#34;Slay the Fire Nix\u0026#34;. Fire Nixes can be killed by a character at this level with some ease, but, as always, gathering them and having someone kill them with an AOE is much faster.\nMore Information As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for details on every quest.

Thank you!\nIts Dangerous to go Alone By now you\u0026#39;ve met Momo and discovered how I, one of the most adorably shy people in the world, managed to fall in love with MMOs, but did you know those two things combined? I didn\u0026#39;t think so. I\u0026#39;m getting a bit ahead of myself though. Let me first start with some things that happened more recently.\nJust last quarter, I was a normal middle school girl, okay, I was still a very shy middle school girl, but I was attending normal classes. One day, however, I passed out during second period. Not long after I was diagnosed with severe anemia. Fearing my safety at school, Tabitha begged for me to be allowed to stay home. She volunteered to help me get assignments and supervise me during the day. My doctor agreed with keeping me at home in bed, but not so much with Tabitha missing her own classes. Instead, I would stay home and Tabitha\u0026#39;s only job was to make sure that she collected any homework assignments and give them to me at the end of the day. The doctors all thought that, with some medication, and supplements, I would be back in school in a few weeks. It has now been months. My teachers have all given up on me. Most of them just say I\u0026#39;ve missed so much class that I would probably have to make up the grade anyway so they stopped sending homework home with my sister.\nNow I just lay around in bed most of the day. I play games on a handheld, but, when I feel up to it, I\u0026#39;ll get up and log into FantasyQuest Online on my laptop. Oh, yeah! When I started FantasyQuest Online I was playing on my sister\u0026#39;s laptop and she would log in downstairs on a family computer, but that quickly changed when she got a part time job and a new laptop. She gave me her old one and we played together with each of us in her room. She would play at her desk, and I would sit on the bed. We still did that sometimes, when she was home from school, even though I had my own desk now.\nOn this day, I was sitting on the edge of my bed, I just grabbed my laptop (I usually kept it on my nightstand unless it needed to be charged or I was well enough to sit at the desk). I contemplated opening it and logging into FantasyQuest Online. Tabitha would be home soon, but I usually didn\u0026#39;t play without her. Only, we were at a particularly difficult part and I wanted to grind a bit so I could get more levels and farm better gear to help out more. I thought it couldn\u0026#39;t hurt to log in without her if I was planning on doing something so boring, so I opened the lid of the laptop. That\u0026#39;s when Discord went off. I unlocked the screen. There was a message from Momo, \u0026#34;Hey!\u0026#34; it started. \u0026#34;I haven\u0026#39;t seen you at school. You okay?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Been super tired lately,\u0026#34; I answered, \u0026#34;doctors want me to stay home.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Bummer,\u0026#34; Momo responded, \u0026#34;I really miss you. School isn\u0026#39;t the same without the most adorable girl.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Awww üòä\u0026#34; I said, \u0026#34;Thanks, I miss you too.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What have you been doing?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Playing FantasyQuest Online and Dragon Ember.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Just playing games? Lucky.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I dunno about lucky,\u0026#34; I said. \u0026#34;Actually, do you want to play with me?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m still in class, silly,\u0026#34; Momo responded.\n\u0026#34;I mean, when you get home,\u0026#34; I added. \u0026#34;Tabitha and I can help you start a character if you don\u0026#39;t have one already.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sure.\u0026#34; Momo agreed. \u0026#34;That\u0026#39;ll be helpful.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay. I\u0026#39;ll talk to you after class?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sure.\u0026#34;\nWith new purpose I logged into FantasyQuest Online and opened the character information window. Since I started this character, she was now level 60 is several jobs and classes. Of course, gunner was her highest class because I worked on it the most, but I wasn\u0026#39;t sure how helpful my level 90 gunner would be to a new player. I had a level 60 white mage and a healer might just help Momo\u0026#39;s new character a lot more than a damage dealer, but I also had a level 20 priestess, which also had a few healing spells, but also had buffs and a summon, plus the closer a party\u0026#39;s levels are to one another the more evenly exp is distributed among the party. You see, when doing quests or killing mobs in FantasyQuest Online, players earn exp, these experience points help level your classes (and jobs, but exp is earned differently for jobs). When a player is in a party, experience from quests and mobs are shared by the party. The player who has the quest earns 50-90% of its experience depending on the level of the other party members, and they gain 5%-95% of exp from mobs. If the other party members are really high they\u0026#39;ll gain much more experience than the lower level characters. A lot of player say this is to discourage power leveling, which is when a high level character carries a lower level character. If that is the reason I think it works really well.\n\u0026#34;Allana,\u0026#34; I heard as I was still debating which class would be most helpful for Momo. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m home!\u0026#34; it was Tabitha, \u0026#34;and I\u0026#39;m not alone!\u0026#34;\nTake me! Standing just over four feet tall with beautiful, majestic, dewy, butterfly-like wings each almost as long as she was tall, the young fairy priestess stood in the middle of a black sand beach surrounded by blue and purple slimes mingling with both large and small crabs. Her robes billowed in the wind. She looked like an angel with long blond hair and purple eyes. All she was doing was waiting, waiting for the arrival of the one who was prophesied. \u0026#34;Artemis,\u0026#34; the priestess heard.\nThe young fairy turned and brushed her hair aside. The human called Tabby Kat, one of her trusted friends and companions stood less than a meter away. The fairy waved a dainty arm. \u0026#34;Tabby,\u0026#34; she called back with a smile.\n\u0026#34;She\u0026#39;s going to be a little late,\u0026#34; the tall figure replied. She had the build of a fighter, but the most gentle green eyes.\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s perfectly alright,\u0026#34; Artemis replied. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ve waited this long, I\u0026#39;m certain a few more minutes won\u0026#39;t hurt.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;MAGIC MISSILE!\u0026#34; someone cried. A bolt of energy shot just passed the small fairy, impacting a purple slime behind her.\nIf the fairy was at all surprised, one wouldn\u0026#39;t be able to find it on her face. \u0026#34;She went with a mage, I see,\u0026#34; she commented.\n\u0026#34;Looks like she did,\u0026#34; the human replied.\nJust as the slime lost its shape another girl appeared. She had dark purple skin, shoulder length black hair, and two small, red horns. \u0026#34;And a devil at that,\u0026#34; Artemis added.\n\u0026#34;What!?\u0026#34; the newcomer questioned.\n\u0026#34;Nothing,\u0026#34; Artemis replied, \u0026#34;I just can\u0026#39;t say this was expected.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Doesn\u0026#39;t my character look cool though?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;She does.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re so adorable!\u0026#34; the girl stated, picking up the fairy in her long arms and giving her a bit of a squeeze.\nArtemis blushed, \u0026#34;Thanks,\u0026#34; she said, \u0026#34;I spent a lot of time getting her just right.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Hours,\u0026#34; Tabby elaborated, Artemis turned a few more shades of red.\n\u0026#34;Hey,\u0026#34; the newcomer said, \u0026#34;I understand! After all, you\u0026#39;re going to look at her a lot, right?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;So,\u0026#34; Artemis said, \u0026#34;what should we call you?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh, you mean like my character name?\u0026#34; Artemis nodded. \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s Momoko, because I\u0026#39;m very good at naming things.\u0026#34; The girl replied with a sarcastic chuckle.\n\u0026#34;Momoko works,\u0026#34; Artemis replied. \u0026#34;I mean my sister is literally TabbyKat, so‚Ä¶\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Hey!\u0026#34; Tabby exclaimed.\n\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re Artemis though, huh?\u0026#34; Momoko said.\n\u0026#34;Its not all that creative either,\u0026#34; the fairy admitted. \u0026#34;Artemis is literally a summon from FantasyQuest II. I\u0026#39;m lucky no one else had the name.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Well we did start during open beta, but yeah, that was some luck,\u0026#34; Tabby noticed.\n\u0026#34;So, do we just sit here and talk?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I mean, Tabby and I do that a lot, kind of like role-playing are specific characters, but that\u0026#39;s probably going to be a bit boring for your first run, so what kind of quests do you have?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t you know already?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;The first few levels of quests are based off your class and race. I\u0026#39;ve only played Fairy and Tabby\u0026#39;s only been a human so we don\u0026#39;t know anything about devils. Tabby tried mage, but you probably won\u0026#39;t get those quests for a couple levels.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Well, I only killed one slime, I need 15 purple and 10 blue.\u0026#34; Momoko explained.\n\u0026#34;Any greens?\u0026#34; Tabby asked.\n\u0026#34;No, I don\u0026#39;t think so,\u0026#34; Momoko answered.\n\u0026#34;Maybe later,\u0026#34; Artemis guessed. \u0026#34;Any drop quests?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Need some crab meat,\u0026#34; Momoko stated.\n\u0026#34;Oh good,\u0026#34; Artemis said, \u0026#34;I need some crab meat too. Let\u0026#39;s start there.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay!\u0026#34;\nFriends who ADVENTURE together stay together The trio spent the next few minutes gather crab meat and several hours helping Momo with quests and getting used to the game. Momo had brought over her brother\u0026#39;s old laptop, but it was in great shape. She sat on Allana\u0026#39;s bed. Allana, who normally tried to play at her desk when she could, sat on the bed with Momo. Tabitha was in her room, but, aside from chatting in-game would occasionally shout things at the group until both Allana and Momo told her to just come over to them. \u0026#34;There\u0026#39;s room at my desk,\u0026#34; Allana reminded.\nWith the trio in the room, it was much easier for everyone to coordinate and they started trying a few of the lower level dungeons. Soon it was approaching midnight. Allana yawned. \u0026#34;Tired?\u0026#34; Momo asked.\n\u0026#34;A little bit,\u0026#34; Allana admitted.\n\u0026#34;Her anemia has given her a weird sleep schedule,\u0026#34; Tabitha chuckled.\n\u0026#34;Yeah,\u0026#34; Allana replied, \u0026#34;we\u0026#39;ll blame the anemia.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I mean, its not far from the truth.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;For sure,\u0026#34; Allana replied. \u0026#34;Its really because I don\u0026#39;t go to school anymore so I just sleep whenever I\u0026#39;m tired. Sometimes I stay up until dawn and then sleep until afternoon, and other times I don\u0026#39;t sleep for like a whole day and pass out around eleven or ten.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Wow, really?\u0026#34; Momo asked.\n\u0026#34;Yeah and then there was the day she slept the whole day and didn\u0026#39;t wake up until five the next morning,\u0026#34; Tabitha added. \u0026#34;That was rough, I wasn\u0026#39;t sure she was going to wake up. I kept checking on her to make sure she was still breathing.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s sounds rough for you,\u0026#34; Momo stated.\nAllana blushed. \u0026#34;How has school been?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;A lot more difficult without you there,\u0026#34; Momo answered.\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m sorry,\u0026#34; Allana said.\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t be, you didn\u0026#39;t choose to get sick,\u0026#34; Momo said. \u0026#34;Besides, I think I\u0026#39;d rather you be here resting then have to deal with all that\u0026#39;s happening right now.\u0026#34; Allana looked confused, but Tabitha just waved it off. There was definetly something the pair of them were trying to keep from her. She wondered what it could be, but decided not to push it just yet. She yawned. She was far too tired to care right now.\n\u0026#34;Want to call it a night?\u0026#34; Tabitha asked.\nAllana turned to Momo, \u0026#34;Come and play again?\u0026#34; she asked.\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know how often I\u0026#39;ll be able to come over,\u0026#34; Momo replied, \u0026#34;but we can always play together, just shoot me a message and I\u0026#39;ll be on‚Ä¶as long as I\u0026#39;m not in school that is.\u0026#34; Momo winked.\n\u0026#34;Okay!\u0026#34; Allana beamed. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll keep my priestess at your level so we can level together!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Thanks!\u0026#34; Momo responded.\n\u0026#34;Alright!\u0026#34; Tabitha interjected, \u0026#34;time for Momo to go home.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Why don\u0026#39;t you just stay over?\u0026#34; Allana asked, \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s already pretty late.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sure,\u0026#34; Momo said, \u0026#34;a sleepover sounds nice.\u0026#34;\nTabitha closed her laptop. \u0026#34;Well,\u0026#34; she said, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m going to bed. Don\u0026#39;t stay up too late, Momo still has school in the morning.\u0026#34;\nThe two did stay up for a bit. They both logged off from the game, but spent several minutes talking. Eventually sleep won though and Allana was taken to dream land.\n","description":"","id":7,"section":"adventures","tags":["allana","tabitha","momo","rebase","original","adventure"],"title":"RE[BASE] Allana: Foreach Friend as Adventurer","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/allana_ep3/"},{"content":" If you have followed my guides so far then you\u0026#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.\nHow best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too. For this stage I\u0026#39;m going to give you a few options for some of the levels. If you have the friends and money they\u0026#39;ll help you level really quickly, if you don\u0026#39;t than you can still solo, or work with a group of close friends your level, and still level, but it\u0026#39;ll be slower.\nLevel 80-90 There is a repeatable for gathering armor pieces in DT. You can have a higher level friend or a DT runner and a few droppers run through DT with you. Make sure you inventory is nearly empty and just fill it with these armor pieces. Once full, leave the dungeon and spam turn ins. Rinse and repeat until your level 90. Don\u0026#39;t forget to get the DT Key and quests. Alternatively, you can just do all the level 7x quests. There are a few somewhat boring reps mixed in there to help you get to 90. The slow way Here are the reps you can do to help you get to 90 if you can\u0026#39;t do DT for some reason:\nLevel 81-84 - Miner Mole Rep - \u0026#34;I Despise Moles\u0026#34; Level 82-84 - Another Mole Rep - \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s Them Again (Repeatable Quest)\u0026#34; Level 84-86 - Kidmon Rep - \u0026#34;Hans in Love\u0026#34; Level 85-88 - Toy Spade Rep - \u0026#34;Kidmon The Menance\u0026#34; Level 86-89 - Jewel Tree Rep - \u0026#34;Tree of Jewels\u0026#34; Level 89-91 - Lava Gargoyle Rep - \u0026#34;Attack of the Lava Gargoyles\u0026#34; Level 90-101 You can now enter Leviathan Nest. You need to complete the quest \u0026#34;Lost Key to the Lighthouse\u0026#34; to get the key. This requires you to slay Nest Slime, which is kinda strong for its level, best to have a friend help. Once here you have the key, you can find a guildie, friend, or other LN runner and just stand around and gather exp. This is nice because you can level while you AFK like in FM, but it can be expansive because runners don\u0026#39;t run it for free, usually. Alternatively, there is a non-LN strategy that is not as easy and is a bit slower, but more than doable. Also, at this point you may begin to do daily quests from the Hunter\u0026#39;s Union. These will allow you to earn tokens to exchange for items and give you a bit of exp every day! The slow way Level 90-94 - RS Rep - Complete the following: \u0026#34;Burning Cave\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Burning Cave 2\u0026#34; to unlock \u0026#34;My hunches never proves wrong\u0026#34; - Rock Stone is also hard to kill for someone at this level, but I love killing RS so just get in-touch with me, or you can have another high level guildie or friend kill it for you while you turn in the rep. Also, the spot in burning cave has a few gargoyles so it is possible to do both quests at once, at least for one level. Level 94-95 - Mandrake Rep - \u0026#34;Outlaw of the Swamp (Repeatable)\u0026#34; - 15 Kill per turn in now! Much better than doing all the other quests, but you could still do those if you want. Level 96-97 - King Rhino Rep - \u0026#34;The Threats of King Rhinoce\u0026#34; - Pretty easy mini-boss, may even be able to solo him, but a higher level killer is faster. Level 98 - do all the 9x quests to get you to 99, if you\u0026#39;re having difficulty reaching 99 even with daily quest and these normal quests, there is also the Ping Pig Horn rep - \u0026#34;Food Thief\u0026#34;, but this is a drop quest and can be difficult to in a party, so it is not recommended. Level 99-101 Whether you did or LN or not the next quest is \u0026#34;Personal Revenge\u0026#34;, which is known as the \u0026#34;Slugs Rep\u0026#34; and should not be confused with the \u0026#34;Mad slugs rep\u0026#34;!\nLevel 101 The \u0026#34;Mad Slugs Rep\u0026#34; mentioned above is a good way to pass level 101, it isn\u0026#39;t very good after that level, but it does remain available. You will have to unlock it though by completing a chain of quests starting with \u0026#34;Suspicious Big Mudmen\u0026#34;. This will unlock \u0026#34;Fire on Hands and Feet\u0026#34; which will finally unlock \u0026#34;Unextinguishable Fire\u0026#34;, which is this rep.\nLevel 102-106 Next repeatable quest is \u0026#34;Black Bear Beatdown\u0026#34; or just BBs. It has been determined that this is now faster than Mad Slugs, though that is still available for you.\nLevel 105 If you did LN above, then just do the BB rep mentioned in the slow way to get you to 106.\nLevel 106-108 Okie, most of the shortcuts are done now so, no matter what, you\u0026#39;re going to have to grind a bit. Fortunately it isn\u0026#39;t really hard. Just remember that a lot of people are going to be doing these quests, see if you can join a party with a dedicated killer and this will go much faster. For these levels, you have the Fire Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Playing with Fire\u0026#34;).\nLevel 109 Complete all quests you\u0026#39;ve saved until this point. If you haven\u0026#39;t had to do the 9x quests than this will be very quick. Otherwise, the quests in OLT are here and they are also fairly quick with any other quests you saved up. OLT is best tackled with a party though.\nLevel 110-116 Nepu Nepu Neeeeep! Its time for the Nep rep. Complete \u0026#34;Collecting Twister Crystals\u0026#34; before getting the repeatable version. Believe it or not, there is nothing to collect for this rep, just killing.\nLevel 112-116 If you can, stay on Neps! There are two additional repeatables avaialble though. Either Mean Leipoons (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 1\u0026#34;) or Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 2\u0026#34;). It is important to note that you will have to completely The Mean Leipoons rep a twice times before the Shellas rep shows up. Its weird, but true.\nLevel 116-118 Wrenches rep. Unfortunately, this quest is buried under a loooong list of prequests, but here they are: \u0026#34;Milly\u0026#39;s Healthy Wonder Medicine 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Unknown Causes.. However\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. Once these are complete you\u0026#39;ll get the repeatable version of \u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. It should also be noted that you can make a ton of money by doing \u0026#34;The Workshop Master is making a weapon\u0026#34; (available at 117) while you are doing the wrenches rep, not to mention this boosts your exp too. It should be mentioned that \u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34; is also a repeatable quest and can be done the same time as wrenches.\nLevel 118-121 Junks rep. This is also buried under a loooong list of prequests (but it is worth it! these quests will give you a lot of exp and the rep gives 2-3% per turn it üò≤), so I\u0026#39;ll give you those too. \u0026#34;Smart Yeti is preparing for an Exam\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Something urgent came up to Hilda\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Sick Akisha\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;North Witch\u0026#39;s dark power\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Someone can help us..

After aaall these quests, you\u0026#39;ll finally get \u0026#34;Selling Junks\u0026#34;\nI\u0026#39;ve learned something just recently. There are a quite a few quests that you can do during this level, including a ton of repeatables. Junks is, by far, the fastest way, but it can be dangerous because of all the Astan\u0026#39;s nearby. For this reason I recommend having a good party with someone tanky to pull and a good killer that could, if needed, one-shot the Astans if they get close. Bonus, a party should be able to tell you exactly where to stand, sit on your mount, or rest during the rep to minimize your likelihood of dying, however, if you don\u0026#39;t have a lot of friends, there are easier, but slower reps. As I mentioned, a TON of them. Just don\u0026#39;t get discouraged by how slow you gain exp. Also, if your in a guild that likes to do Siren\u0026#39;s Castle raids and has a few good runners, ask if you can tag along for quests. This will be a good way to gain looots of exp at once, but be sure they are okay with you joining and it would probably good to spend some money on scrolls, tevas and charms, don\u0026#39;t forget to grab all the dungeon quests, they should have a sword icon!\nCongrats You are now a bone-fide adventurer.

Thank you!\nIs Soloing Fun? I have to say, school may have been very nerve-wracking, but at least I always had a way to pass the time. Whether that meant studying, classes, or homework. Of course, I had less time to play games, but I don\u0026#39;t think that was always a bad thing.\nOn one day in particular, I was lounging around the house by myself. I had gotten out of bed and even managed to get dressed, but I was still not allowed to go to school, so I loaded up a handheld with a new visual novel and just lounged on an arm chair with it.\nI was about two hours into the new story when I sat up and glanced around. I don\u0026#39;t know what exactly I was looking for and I don\u0026#39;t know exactly what got me to sit up, but I heard myself say, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m bored.\u0026#34; Of course, I was the only one around to hear it. Maybe the new VN was not as interesting as some of the others I played, or maybe I was just tired of lying there pressing one or two buttons over-and-over again. Either way I saved the game and closed the handheld. I looked over at the clock on the wall above the living room TV. \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s a little too early for lunch,\u0026#34; I said. Of course, I hadn\u0026#39;t even had breakfast, but I usually didn\u0026#39;t these days. I still didn\u0026#39;t want to eat too early. \u0026#34;Why did I even bother getting up so early?\u0026#34;\nI paced for a bit then went into my room. I sat the handheld down and grabbed my laptop from the drawer in my nightstand. I set it up at my desk and stared at my wallpaper. I don\u0026#39;t know what I was thinking. There wasn\u0026#39;t much I could do on my laptop except watch videos on a larger screen or play FantasyQuest Online. I mentioned this before, but I usually waited until Tabatha got home before I played FantasyQuest. Of course, because of the time we spent playing with Momo, there was still some grinding that I wanted to do on my main class. I could just do that.\nI opened the FantasyQuest Online launcher and just stared at it for a bit again, not sure if this is really what I wanted to do. Without my sister I\u0026#39;d be soloing, and I wasn\u0026#39;t sure if that would be all that fun or if someone in our guild would make fun of me for being on so early or try to party me and get me to help them. I didn\u0026#39;t mind helping out, when my sister was with me, but I wasn\u0026#39;t sure I could handle it on my own.\nA notification went off on my desktop as I stared at the launcher window, breaking me from the trance it put me in with a start. \u0026#34;Hey, what are you doing online? Shouldn\u0026#39;t you be in school?\u0026#34; it was a Discord message from my programmer friend.\n\u0026#34;Shouldn\u0026#39;t you be at work XD\u0026#34; I replied.\n\u0026#34;I am at work XP\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Durn,\u0026#34; I typed. \u0026#34;Was hoping you could hop one FantasyQuest with me.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sorry, its crunch day so I really need to focus on my work.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s okay.\u0026#34; I said. It was impossible for him to tell from just the words typed on the screen, but I was genuinely disappointed. I wanted something to do, but I didn\u0026#39;t want to be alone. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll let you get back to work then.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;We can play together later,\u0026#34; the man responded.\n\u0026#34;Have fun at work,\u0026#34; I wished. I decided to open FantasyQuest Online after all. I was desperate for something to do.\n\u0026#34;Have fun too,\u0026#34; the man sent. We exchanged a couple more smiley faces as the game loaded and that was the end of that conversation.\nSoloing is not fun! Donning a simple farmer\u0026#39;s frock with a blue striped bandanna, Artemis, set out from the city of Purinas, a wicker basket in hand. For the first time the lone fairy would be questing on her own. Tabby and Momoko were both too busy. Artemis, of course, had too much time on her hand so she decided to take up the job herbalist. Her first task was to gather a fairly common herb, parsley. She was told exactly where to go to get it, but was also reminded that it grew pretty much all over the fields to the north and west of Purinas. She had used a transport stone to get her to the city and now set out in search of the herb.\nThe fields to the north of the small city were not far off from the beach. Artemis could almost taste the salt water from the nearby ocean as she looked over the hills looking for parsley. There were plenty of herbs mixed in with the grasses and moss that covered the field just south of the small beach, but few seemed to be parsley and even fewer seemed to be ready to pick. \u0026#34;This is going to take forever,\u0026#34; she muttered to herself as she finally located some parsley and started to gather it into her basket. The fairy looked over a slip of paper she was given when she joined the herbalist\u0026#39;s guild. \u0026#34;I need 20 bundles!\u0026#34; she sighed.\nIt was little wonder why Artemis, despite her small size, choose the life of adventurer. Beings a tradeswoman was hard work! Adventuring was mostly pretty easy. Sure, she had to fight sometimes and even had to take on some pretty dangerous monsters, but her firearms were usually enough to fell most beasts with relative ease. Gathering, on the hand, that required a lot of time and effort. Effort that her tiny body wasn\u0026#39;t really prepared for.\n\u0026#34;19!\u0026#34; Artemis counted, \u0026#34;20!\u0026#34; she added. It seemed to take hours, in fact, the sun, which was high in the sky when she started, was now beginning to set. She was so tired that walking was becoming difficult. She flapped her beautiful, iridescent wings just long enough for them to carry her to a nearby tree. \u0026#34;Parsly, even fresh, won\u0026#39;t spoil too quickly, right?\u0026#34; she asked herself. Naturally she wasn\u0026#39;t about to actually wait for the answer. Artemis sat her basket down next to the tree and placed her own weary body right against its trunk.\nJust as her eyes began to slide closed a noise jolted her awake. It was her hearing stone. \u0026#34;Artemis!\u0026#34; someone called through the stone. She pulled the stone out, it was purple, someone was trying to get a hold of her directly.\n\u0026#34;Hello?\u0026#34; she replied.\n\u0026#34;Hey, it\u0026#39;s David, how are you?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Mostly okay.\u0026#34; Artemis recognized the name. This was one of her sister\u0026#39;s friends. Naturally, he didn\u0026#39;t mind adding her too, but the two of them rarely spoke even when her sister was on.\n\u0026#34;Cool, cool! Hey, is Tabby around somewhere?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Nope,\u0026#34; Artemis answered.\n\u0026#34;Oh? Weird, aren\u0026#39;t you two usually on together?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah, but she\u0026#39;s busy today, and I\u0026#39;m bored,\u0026#34; Artemis laughed.\n\u0026#34;How bored?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What do you mean?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll back up. What are you up to?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Trying my hand at a job.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Which one?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Herblist,\u0026#34; Artemis answered.\n\u0026#34;Cool, cool. How\u0026#39;s that feeling for you?\u0026#34; David wondered.\n\u0026#34;Tiring.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I bet. It\u0026#39;s probably the best job for a fairy though, especially if you plan on going into alchemy, which can really enhance a priestess class.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Really?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;For sure! Hey, do you want to meet up? I have some herbs I can give you.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Umm, that\u0026#39;s okay, I just started. In fact, I\u0026#39;m just about to go turn in my first ever commission as a herblist.\u0026#34; In truth, the thought of meeting up with one of Tabby\u0026#39;s friends without her just felt kind of wrong and she was more than a little nervous.\n\u0026#34;Trust me, it\u0026#39;ll save you quite a lot of work later.\u0026#34;\nArtemis got up and dusted off her frock. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m going to turn in my quest in Ordin. You can meet me by the herblist\u0026#39;s guild leader.\u0026#34; She wanted to just leave or ignore his request, but the more she thought about it the more she felt like that would be rude. Besides, she couldn\u0026#39;t say no to less work gathering later on.\n\u0026#34;Works for me,\u0026#34; David agreed. Artemis gathered her basket, and placed her small hands together. One simple chant later and she had disappeared from the peaceful field north of Purinas.\nIs sister\u0026#39;s friend my friend too? I didn\u0026#39;t hear Tabatha come home after school. I didn\u0026#39;t even hear her come in to my room. \u0026#34;Having fun without me?\u0026#34; She asked.\n\u0026#34;What!?\u0026#34; I questioned. I quickly sent a BRB message to David in our party chat, and turned to face my sister, who had just plopped her school bag by my door and herself on my bed. \u0026#34;I-I was just‚Ä¶umm‚Ä¶I started a job and‚Ä¶\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Relax,\u0026#34; Tabitha said. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m kidding. Actually, I\u0026#39;m happy to see you\u0026#39;re on by yourself. Who are you in a party with?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh,\u0026#34; I said. \u0026#34;Um, its you\u0026#39;re friend David, he was looking for you, but decided to help me work on my herblist.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah. I started it because I was too bored for my VNs today.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Too bored for a VN, really?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah. I did some grinding to get ready for that epic quest we\u0026#39;re doing, but then I decided to try a job.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s great! You picked herblist, huh? That\u0026#39;ll be good for your new priestess and fairies have a natural affinity for plants.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;David said so too.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Well he is pretty good at the game, so I\u0026#39;m not surprised. I\u0026#39;ll let you two get back to questing.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You sure you don\u0026#39;t want to join us?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I guess I could hop on, he did say he was looking for me, right?\u0026#34; Tabitha said.\n\u0026#34;He did,\u0026#34; I responded.\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll get on then, maybe we can finish that epic quest before bed.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll ask David if he can help with that while you get set up,\u0026#34; I suggested. Tabitha left my room and I sent a message in party chat to tell David that I was back. We finished up the commission I was on and then I told him about the quest Tabitha and I were on. He agreed to help and we headed to the right dungeon together, after inviting Tabitha to our party.\nIt felt really good to make another friend. Sure, I had people, including David on my friend list, but they were all people who knew my sister and I rarely talked to them. For the first time ever I not only talked to one of my friends without my sister present, but even gathered some herbs and finished a few commissions together. What started as a kind of sad and lonely day ended with a fun party in a big dungeon and an epic boss fight with just three players. It was a long fight, but we won.\nOf course the entire dungeon and the boss fight took almost three hours and, by the time we were done it was time for a very quick dinner with some left overs from my sister\u0026#39;s lunch and a bath. I decided I would go to bed at the same time as my sister today, but I had thought about staying up and seeing if I could maybe make another friend. One new friend a day was enough though, and I was tired after spending most of my day on FantasyQuest Online.\n","description":"","id":9,"section":"adventures","tags":["allana","tabitha","rebase","original","adventure"],"title":"RE[BASE] Allana: Party is Null","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/allana_ep4/"},{"content":" After following my guide thus far you\u0026#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) üòÖ So, hopefully, you\u0026#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps üòú Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.\nHow Best to Exploit repeatables from 121 to cap, according to Yayoi Okay, okay, all of the reps from here on, well from 116 on really, have a looooooooot of prequests, but they are pretty much essential for leveling now, so there isn\u0026#39;t much you can do about it, sadly. Just hunker down, grab some friends, and grind, grind, grind.\nLevels 121-123 Do the Beaks and Shellas repeat (if you can\u0026#39;t tell there are too many different types of Shellas in this game üòÜ). To get this repeat complete these quests in this order. \u0026#34;Embarrassed Basilone\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone is avoiding to answer\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Bailone\u0026#39;s Colleagues\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues belongings 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Present for Jey\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s Colleague\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s Lie\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Suspicious Basilone\u0026#34;. That is seriously a lot üòµ‚Äçüí´, but it will unlock \u0026#34;Continues Suspicion\u0026#34;, a fairly good rep, and give you quite a lot of exp to boot, so it isn\u0026#39;t all bad.\nLevels 124-126 When I was new I had a friend who insisted the wood rep was a good one to do here, but I think they just liked it because it was an easy solo question ü§≠. If you want you can look it up, but there are better quests. In fact there are two repeatables that are much faster! Also, there is the Bijou Sancturary KQ.\nIf you want to unlock the two repeatables each on has a bit of a quest chain:\n\u0026#34;The Henneath Alliance power is needed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Vale Megantereon\u0026#39;s threat\u0026#34; \u0026#34;The Henneath Alliance power is needed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Nicolas\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Vale Snowy Wolf\u0026#39;s threat\u0026#34; Level 125 Again, the rep here is slow, so quest and do BS KQ. If you don\u0026#39;t quite make it to 126, or you\u0026#39;re tired of running around complete these prequests: \u0026#34;Ancient Scriptures (1-5)\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Oh Captain, My Captain! (1-7)\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;The Arrival‚Äù\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Lending A Hand\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Nighttime disturbance\u0026#34;. After that, you\u0026#39;ll gain two reps \u0026#34;Their Health Is In Danger\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Nighttime disurbance\u0026#34;. In the right spot, both reps can be done together.\nLevel 126-128 You can do the maru rep for this level though the previous rep is available if you want to stick to it. The maru rep is known as \u0026#34;Protecting the Camp\u0026#34;\nYou can also start the mushies rep. This rep takes 6-8 hours with a full party of droppers (be nice and save the quest so you can be a dropper for others). To get this rep you only need to complete the \u0026#34;Mushrooms for Ursula\u0026#34; prequest. Note (because no one told me this): You will need one basket from the item merchant in Isle of Eya for the prequest and then a second one for the rep. Just make sure to keep the basket in your inventory until your done.\nLevels 128-130 The second wood rep. This is much faster than mushies, but is still better with a full party of droppers. Just look for \u0026#34;Serben and His Woods\u0026#34;. The first will be a non-repeatable, turn it back into to Serben to get the repeatable version.\nLevels 130-135 From this point until cap, you will want to make sure you complete your daily quests and compete in available KQs. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 game time. You have some rep options to help fill your time.\nLevel 130-131 - \u0026#34;Success is everything\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 1\u0026#34; Level 130-132 - \u0026#34;Front Lines\u0026#34; Level 132-134 - \u0026#34;The Predator Leader\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 2\u0026#34; Level 134-135 - \u0026#34;The Final Ingredient\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 3\u0026#34; Final Note: The 135 reps are very slow. Focus on your dailies and KQS and complete any quests you haven\u0026#39;t done those far (aside from those your dropping for) to help move things a bit faster.\n","description":"Bone-fide adventurers are characters leveling from 121-135, these are their stories","id":10,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Bone-fide Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/adventurer/"},{"content":" This is an original story.

Thank you!\nIt is Halloween Nite! It happened suddenly. Artemis was up late. She loved watching the sun rise on occasions just like this one. Even if Tabby or Momoko weren\u0026#39;t around she would sometimes come to Ordin just to see the sight of the first rays of sunlight glistening off the many windows of the city. She looked at the large clock at the center of town. Surely it was about that time, yet there was no hint of sunlight. It was simply not possible that sunrise could be this far off. Was it?\nInstead of the first rays of the sun greeting her, a loud explosion echoed through the sky followed by another and then more. The sky was set ablaze in various colors. What is going on? Artemis asked herself as a voice chimed in over her hearing stone, which now glowed bright yellow. This meant a general announcement to all adventurers. \u0026#34;Hello citizens of Gaia\u0026#34; the voice stated. \u0026#34;welcome to this year\u0026#39;s All Hallow\u0026#39;s Eve event. Let the eternal night begin!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What?\u0026#34; Artemis gasped. She tapped her hearing stone until it was green. Hoping she could reach someone in her guild, she said. \u0026#34;What do they mean by an eternal night?\u0026#34;\nShould I Change Plans? I stared at the message in guild chat for a few minutes. Didn\u0026#39;t you check the event logs in the launcher? someone had replied. I rarely paid any attention to the launcher unless the big \u0026#34;Enter Gaia\u0026#34; button was grayed out. Seeing as Tabitha and Momo weren\u0026#39;t on and I really was just waiting for a sunrise, I decided to log out and take a look.\n\u0026#34;Allana,\u0026#34; my sister said, knocking on my door, \u0026#34;you up for breakfast today?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Come in here!\u0026#34; I cried. I think I may have sounded a little more desperate than I meant too as Tabitha throw the door open and ran in.\n\u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s wrong?\u0026#34; she asked.\n\u0026#34;Look at this!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh, its just that. They\u0026#39;re starting the Halloween event, huh?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah, but why didn\u0026#39;t I hear about it? I went to Ordin to watch the sunrise and everything.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know, but I\u0026#39;m sure they announced it. What\u0026#39;s the problem with the event? Is it bugged?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t think so.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Come on, we\u0026#39;ll explore it later, why not have breakfast, it is Halloween after all.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t you still have school?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Kind of, the high school is making a hunted school for the elementary school kids. I told them I\u0026#39;d rather stay home with my sister and they said it was okay since we won\u0026#39;t have classes today.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh,\u0026#34; I replied. I don\u0026#39;t think I sounded as enthusiastic as I really was. Though the word may have been kinda of flat and maybe a bit terse, I was actually really happy that my sister would be able to stay with me the whole day. \u0026#34;Hey,\u0026#34; I wondered, \u0026#34;do you think Momo has classes?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m not sure,\u0026#34; Allana replied. \u0026#34;I didn\u0026#39;t hear what the middle school was doing today. Why not ask her after breakfast?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay,\u0026#34; I said. I changed into a comfortable outfit and headed down to the dining room. Tabitha already had a cozy breakfast of rolled omelets, rice, and natto set out for me. I ate while I sent a text to Momo.\n\u0026#34;Sorry\u0026#34; she answered. \u0026#34;School is still going on like normal until last period. Don\u0026#39;t think I can sneak away.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s okay,\u0026#34; I sent.\n\u0026#34;So,\u0026#34; Tabitha asked as I finished my breakfast. She was gathering my plates. \u0026#34;What did Momo say?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;She still has school,\u0026#34; this time I\u0026#39;m not sure if the disappointment in my voice was enough.\n\u0026#34;Well, that\u0026#39;s a bummer,\u0026#34; Tabitha said, \u0026#34;but I do have an idea!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You do?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yep, how are you feeling today? Energetic?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Pretty good actually, why?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;We\u0026#39;re going shopping!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Shopping! I don\u0026#39;t know!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t worry, we\u0026#39;re not going to buy a lot,\u0026#34; Tabitha said. \u0026#34;In and out and you\u0026#39;ll really like the result.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know,\u0026#34; I repeated.\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll be fun!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What about FantasyQuest?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;We\u0026#39;ll have plenty of time to check out the event! Come on!\u0026#34;\nIts a Party!? I was almost literally dragged out of the house. I was very happy that I had decided to get dressed before breakfast. I\u0026#39;m not sure what I really expected when my sister said we were going shopping either. Maybe I figured we would go get some things for dinner or maybe she wanted to get me a new outfit or something. The second part wasn\u0026#39;t too far from reality though. She did have an outfit of sorts in mind.\nOnce out of the house, she let my arm go and we walked over the mall. I expected, at this time, that we would head over to a department store, maybe a bookstore, but nope, there was a Halloween shop in the mall, and that\u0026#39;s where we were heading. \u0026#34;I hope they haven\u0026#39;t sold all the good costumes,\u0026#34; Tabitha said.\n\u0026#34;Costumes?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Come on you used to love dressing up on Halloween!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I also used to be five! Why do I need a costume!? I don\u0026#39;t have anyone to show it off to!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That hurt,\u0026#34; Tabitha remarked.\n\u0026#34;I meant anyone else,\u0026#34; I added.\n\u0026#34;Well you have Momo, right?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sure, but‚Ä¶\u0026#34; I started. Then something clicked in my head. \u0026#34;What are you planning?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;ll see, but you\u0026#39;ll need a costume first! What do you want?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Fine.\u0026#34; I picked something that I wouldn\u0026#39;t mind wearing, but also, didn\u0026#39;t expect they\u0026#39;d have in my size. \u0026#34;A fairy.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh, like Artemis, that\u0026#39;s cute!\u0026#34; Tabitha replied.\nLittle did I know this shop not only carried fairy costumes in all sizes, and many of the adult one\u0026#39;s weren\u0026#39;t even overly sexy, but they still had one that was exactly my size. I was doomed. Well, first I was shoved into a changing room. I wouldn\u0026#39;t be doomed until after I walked out.\nWhen I did I heard the loudest shriek from my sister I\u0026#39;d ever heard. Her eyes were locked on me. \u0026#34;Kyuuuute!!\u0026#34; she exclaimed. I\u0026#39;m sure, if this was an anime or a VN, she would have hearts in her eyes or something. \u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s the one!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know, it\u0026#39;s a little short don\u0026#39;t you think?\u0026#34; I was referring to the skirt. I mean I knew most fairies in movies and anime had short skirts, but I\u0026#39;ve never been forced to wear one myself.\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t worry, sis,\u0026#34; Tabitha said with a wink, \u0026#34;you have nice legs and I\u0026#39;m not planning on inviting boys.\u0026#34; So she was planning on inviting others. Just what was happening?\nI quickly changed back into the outfit I came in before she could tell me to wear the costume out of the store. The costume was begged back up, but Tabitha snatched it from my hands before I could even think of putting it back and took it to the counter.\nI don\u0026#39;t know if she was trying to placate me, but, after returning home with her catch, Tabitha sent me to my room and instructed me to get on FantasyQuest. I wasn\u0026#39;t going to say no.\nBefore long she was there too. We looked around the various maps and did a few fun event-themed quests and dungeons. After our third dungeon, Tabitha slipped the costume into my room. She instructed me to change because, \u0026#34;it would be starting soon.\u0026#34; I still had no idea what she was talking about, but, for some unfathomable reason, I did what I was told. I left the wings off while we worked on a few more quests. Oh, and I added a pair of white tights to the costume, because the skirt really was short.\nWe were working through a special event dungeon when I heard the door bell ring. \u0026#34;Bad timing,\u0026#34; Tabitha sent in party chat. We got to a quiet part of the dungeon and Tabitha asked me to hold the fort for a bit while she answered the door. There wasn\u0026#39;t much for me to worry about.\nI heard more than one new set of footsteps, but they didn\u0026#39;t come up the stairs. \u0026#34;We\u0026#39;ll get started in a minute,\u0026#34; I heard my sister say. \u0026#34;Just let us finish something I promised my sister.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;No problem,\u0026#34; I heard Momo reply.\nWe finished the dungeon and my sister, dressed in an old black cat costume from two years ago that still managed to fit her, came and fetched me. \u0026#34;You ready?\u0026#34; she asked. \u0026#34;Where are your wings!?\u0026#34; I pointed to the pair of fairy wings on my bed. \u0026#34;Put them on, we have guests!\u0026#34;\nI was both embarrassed and nervous as I slipped the wings on and followed Tabitha down the stairs.\n\u0026#34;Happy Halloween!\u0026#34; I heard. Momo was dressed as a warewolf and there were a couple of other girls, which I\u0026#39;m guessing were friends of my sister. One of them was dressed as one of my favorite magical girls. She spoke next \u0026#34;We heard you had to spend Halloween alone, and we couldn\u0026#39;t have that, so we\u0026#39;re having a party!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t be shy,\u0026#34; Tabitha said. \u0026#34;They are all friends.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah,\u0026#34; Momo added.\nIt took me a few minutes to get comfortable with everyone, but they brought me candy and snacks so they couldn\u0026#39;t be bad, right? We enjoyed watching movies together and hanging out. In the end I think I may have made a few new friends. The girl who was dressed up as a magical girl was named Carol, but my sister just called her Coco, for some reason. She also played FantasyQuest Online and promised to add me as a friend when she got home.\nAll in all, thought I didn\u0026#39;t play all the event content today, I really enjoyed spending time with everyone. I was happy to have new friends and everyone was super nice and didn\u0026#39;t mind that I struggled to talk sometimes. Coco, like Momo, thought it was cute actually. Quoting a character from a VN I played, she even said. \u0026#34;I want to take you home!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Over my dead body,\u0026#34; Tabitha joked. \u0026#34;She\u0026#39;s my sister!\u0026#34; With that she squeezed me tightly and I just beamed in her arms. Don\u0026#39;t think I would have minded if Coco took me home though. She liked a lot of the same anime, VN, and other games that I liked. I kind of wonder if she had any magical girl figurines or plushies. I wouldn\u0026#39;t be finding that out right away though.\nThe evening ended with me heading to bed and everyone else saying goodbye before remarking that it was a school night still and they should go home and get some sleep. We all said good bye and I had great dreams that night.\n","description":"","id":11,"section":"adventures","tags":["allana","tabitha","momo","rebase","original","adventure"],"title":"RE[BASE] Allana: Spooky Nite!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/allana_ep5/"},{"content":" Hi hi üëã You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over two years ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I was completely addicted ü§™ If I\u0026#39;m honest, Fiesta Online isn\u0026#39;t exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I\u0026#39;ve made friends and just can\u0026#39;t seem to leave them. So I\u0026#39;m still playing, even if I\u0026#39;m only slowly leveling one character üòÖ, and spending most of my time playing other games.\nOver the last year, I learned that I don\u0026#39;t really like playing Fiesta Online much. I\u0026#39;m still on every now and then, but I\u0026#39;d rather spend time on other games. However, I have also been a member of several guildes and picked up a few things from them, including some guides. If you\u0026#39;re looking for some help then check out those guides or just find me in game. I\u0026#39;d still be happy to help üòÅ\nThough Fiesta is the game play most consistently, I am occasionally on other games, including other MMOs. Some MMOs I like are Final Fantasy XIV, Tower of Fantasy, and Ys Online. Chances are, if you run into a character named Yayoi, YayoiChi, Yayoi Chi, or something similar than I\u0026#39;m playing her! MMOs aren\u0026#39;t all I play, I also play other online games like Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, and I\u0026#39;m a big fan of retro games, like Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers, and JRPGS, my favorite of which is the Xenosaga Saga and Persona series. In fact, I love these games so much, I\u0026#39;ve added some guides from them!\nAlso, I make a pretty good friend. If you happen to be on Steam, Mastodon, or Matrix, you can add me. I put links to my profiles on the bottom of the site. You can use these and the e-mail link to get in touch with suggestions or issues with the site as well, though a prefer to hear about page specific problems in their comments, thank you!\n","description":"My name is Yayoi and I love playing games. If you wanna learn more this is the page to do it!","id":12,"section":"","tags":["about"],"title":"Introduction","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/introduction/"},{"content":" I realized that a news article that just barely mentioned commissions was probably not enough to lay out all the information one might need to know to get started if they wanted to commission me. This page will rectify that. I will lay out what I am willing to draw, what I am not willing to draw, and how you can contact me if you are interested. I will also go over how I expect to be paid.\nWhat I am willing to draw First, I don\u0026#39;t mind expanding my skills, so this is not an extensive list of everything I will draw. You can think of this more like a list of things I feel comfortable drawing. I\u0026#39;ll draw pretty much anything so long as its not in the list of things I won\u0026#39;t draw, but I am particularly good a few things things and those things are:\nCute girls! Yep I like drawing cute girls, if they are cute enough I might even draw fan-art. By the way, fan-art is legally questionable, I will not handle getting permission to draw other people\u0026#39;s characters, that\u0026#39;s up to you, and you must let me know you have permissions before I start! Character designs. Similar to the above I can design new characters for you. I will do my very best if that character is a guy, but I am very good with cute girls. If you don\u0026#39;t want cute though‚Ä¶probably should look elsewhere to be honest üòÖ. Still profile pictures. I can even make profile pictures, just don\u0026#39;t expect animations. Wallpapers, we\u0026#39;ll talk about that, but I am willing to try. Other backgrounds, and \u0026#34;cards\u0026#34;, these can be great for streamers. If you need a background to use while you stream, or if you need like a stand-by card, start card, or end card when you stream, contact me, I\u0026#39;ll do my best! Don\u0026#39;t forget that you can always reach out and let me know you are interested, and I\u0026#39;ll decide if I think I can do a good job and we\u0026#39;ll discuss things further, as long as your idea doesn\u0026#39;t fall into the categories of things I am not willing to draw below!\nWhat I am not willing to draw This is a bit more straightforward and there isn\u0026#39;t much negotiating on anything here. Sure, you can always talk about it, but there isn\u0026#39;t much chance I will work on a commissions on any of these topics!\nViolence, I am against my characters getting hurt and will likely not wish this on any other characters. Still, violence can happen and mild violence is usually okay, but anything too extreme and I won\u0026#39;t draw it, that\u0026#39;s that! Gore. Yep not touching that at all. Anything too gory and that\u0026#39;s a complete no-go. If I even get a whiff of it then I\u0026#39;ll stop you right there! Sexual content. Yeah I don\u0026#39;t draw Hentai, no exceptions. Also if it involves a certain male body part at all, then‚Ä¶yeah not going to happen. Light romance and some questionable things may make it if you ask nicely Anything that targets or marginalizes any group of people regardless of how large or small that groups is. This includes anything that targets racial stereotypes, stereotypes involving one\u0026#39;s sexual orientation or gender identity, or any hate toward anyone! Political party logos or anything that could be interpreted as my endorsement of any political group. Sorry just not going there! How to contact me if you are interested in a commission The best bet is to contact me via the right GitHub Discussions caregory. I have set this up for this exact purpose, however, this does require a GitHub account and I understand that there may be some who do not have and do not want a GitHub account. For that reason I have several other methods you can use. You can also try e-mailing me directly. If that also doesn\u0026#39;t suit you, check out my Steam, Mastodon, or Matrix accounts at the bottom of these and every page. We\u0026#39;ll discuss things over the DMs there! Whatever is most comfortable for you.\nHow will you pay me? At this time all pricing will be discussed before I start your commission. Once we have decided on a price you are willing to pay, I will send you a payment link for $50 dollars. This is a deposit and it is not refundable. Once you pay that, I will begin work. Depending on how we establish payments you may receive other payment links or one final link for the full price after work is completed. You will be expected to pay that link before the final commission is delivered to you.\nAll payment is processed through Stripe. Stripe is a third-party payment processor. This is done to ensure protection for both you, as the client, and myself, as the artist. If you have any further questions on payment, we can discuss them, but no other payment processor will be accepted and I do not accept cash, check, or money order.\n","description":"This page lays out what I can do for you as well as basic expectations I have if you want to commission me to draw for you.","id":13,"section":"","tags":["about"],"title":"About Commissions","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/commissions/"},{"content":" For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I\u0026#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I\u0026#39;m ahead!\nAbout Commissions for December I said, in my last article that I was putting a pause on my commissions for the month of December and that I would be back to taking commissions on the 2nd of January. First off, this has not changed! Commissions are still closed and will remain closed until 2 Jan! I think one of the reasons I am ahead is because I did not take commissions this week and, if I want to stay ahead I need to keep the commissions closed, at least for now. I\u0026#39;m confidant that personal projects will be all done by Jan and I will be happy to resume then!\nPersona 4 Golden Even though I\u0026#39;m writing a guide for Persona 4 Golden, I might also write a review. I have some thoughts and I don\u0026#39;t think the walkthrough or guides are a good place to put them. That said, I am still making great progress and I think I might just finish the game soon. I\u0026#39;d like to get it done before the end of the year, but I also don\u0026#39;t want to set that as a goal, because I\u0026#39;m not sure its very realistic. There are less than thirty days left in 2023 üò≤\nThere are a few things that I will be doing with the Persona 4 walkthrough soon, as well as the other guides:\nRemove some of the unneeded comments\nDuring my playthrough I took notes and some of those notes are still in the walkthrough, but don\u0026#39;t actually help the player so those will be removed. Remove any comment about the availability of particular characters or activities unless they are affected by the story (this is particularly bad with Marie). These should be moved to the S-Link guides (more on that later). Move the, sub-boss/boss tables (these will be redundant), and create links to other pages for them. Work on the other guides\nMove all notes about character, job, or activity availability to bonefide S-Link guides if applicable. Create guides for Jobs specifically which will talk mostly about the benefits of each job as well as pay for each one. Most jobs have an S-Link, so availability of job beyond basic schedule will be in that guide. Create a quest guide, this might be a bit later since I didn\u0026#39;t do much with quests. Create a boss and dungeon strategy guide and place current boss/sub-boss tables there. It is my hope that this will help shorten the walkthrough and organize guides a bit better so that players will be able to find what the need when they need it. As for the walkthrough, it is up to date now with my current playthrough. I am almost do the next dungeon so we\u0026#39;ll soon have a better heading for the second part üòú\nNagisa! Anyone who my be looking at my non-gaming adventures my have noticed a new episode up with the name of a new character. Of course, if you read my last article this wouldn\u0026#39;t be a surprise. I mentioned Nagisa there, but now her first episode is officially out!\nNagisa is a short, petite girl who is a virtual idol (think vTuber) and a college freshman. I\u0026#39;m still not sure if and how Nagisa will meet Allana. I\u0026#39;m thinking they should meet because of some future story points, but we\u0026#39;ll see. Also art for Nagisa and her vTuber Nanako will be out at some point. Actually you\u0026#39;ll probably see Nagisa around Christmas. Look forward to more Nagisa soon! Also, Allana\u0026#39;s story isn\u0026#39;t done, so don\u0026#39;t go thinking Nagisa is replacing Allana!\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"news","tags":["site","personal","news","rebase"],"title":"Actually on Track","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/actually-on-track/"},{"content":" Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there\u0026#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut üòâ) next week. Plus a few more announcements I\u0026#39;m working on!\nThe Christmas Season has Started! Every year since high school, I have been drawing a special Christmas illustration. This has served as a Christmas present for family and friends. There have been some years where this was the only present I could give out because I could not afford anything else. You can say my talents save me from not having any thing to give. So, for me, the Christmas season starts right after thanksgiving. This is when I begin the planning process for the year\u0026#39;s Christmas picture.\nThis year is not different. As you know Thankgiving is over and I have begun planning this year\u0026#39;s illustration. The idea and pose are all ready, but I have not yet started the artwork itself. That will happen soon, but I am currently still working on another project. Specifically, and illustration for RE[BASE], however, I will not be accepting new commissions until after the holidays. If you want something commissioned, please contact me after 2 Jan 2024!\nIllustrations for RE[BASE] As soon as I described Allana\u0026#39;s Halloween outfit in episode 5 I knew this was going to be the first illustration. Of course I stuck it a little low on that page because I wanted it to after I described it, but its there and you can also see it in my creations gallery. There was another scene in an earlier episode that I wanted to draw as well, so I have already started that. It will be done soon and I will add it to the story and gallery. At some point, I might have a separate gallery for RE[BASE], but we\u0026#39;ll see. This illustration is also why I haven\u0026#39;t started my Christmas illustration yet. It turned out the pose and angel are more difficult than I thought. Please let me know if it\u0026#39;s worth it üòÖ\nRE[BASE]: Nagisa Let\u0026#39;s go live! I would like to officially announce the debut of Nagisa! Negisa will debut (in the world of RE[BASE]) next week. As of this posting of this article, I would have started writing her first episode. This year\u0026#39;s Christmas illustration will also feature this new character. Look forward to see her first episode next week. Her story will run, in part, in parallel to Allana\u0026#39;s. Allana will not be featured in her story right away, but they may meet at a future time. I hope you like her!\nVNs and Persona 4 Golden The walkthrough for Persona 4 Golden is slowly coming along. I am approaching the end of Oct in the story and will hope to get the next dungeon up soon. While playing Persona 4 Golden, I am also playing a few visual novels. I forgot how much I enjoy these. I am hoping to finish Clannad and it will be the first review of a visual novel I put up on this. Because of the nature of VNs, I\u0026#39;m not going to put any guides up for them. If you really want to find secret routes or make the \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; choices, there are plenty of other places you can go. I think you should make choices the way you think would be best for you in your first play through, than try different things out as you re-play them though. That\u0026#39;s where the enjoyment is, I think, so I won\u0026#39;t be guiding you, but I\u0026#39;ll let you know what I think of them as I finish them.\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"news","tags":["rebase","allana","news","site"],"title":"Not Just Allana","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/not-just-allana/"},{"content":" Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics. I also hope to add more VNs that I have on my Steam wishlist to the reviews. I\u0026#39;m still working on finishing Persona 4 Golden, but I focused more on getting homework done this week so I wouldn\u0026#39;t fall behind during the holiday. I will be putting up the commissions I finished last week though.\nThe Turkey Debate It has come to my attention, from meetings and other sources, that there are people who don\u0026#39;t like Turkey üò≤ I can see why some people wouldn\u0026#39;t like the bird. It can be very difficult to cook because of the different meats, and it can be very bad dry. I like it though, it is a good canvas for sauces and gravy and its very versatile left over. So, I still think it is the best part of Thanksgiving. Though I will say I prefer ham on other holidays like Christmas. There\u0026#39;s nothing quite like a Christmas ham! I\u0026#39;ll also say I wouldn\u0026#39;t mind trying another fowl, maybe ostrich üòÜ\nExpanding the Reviews I have done a new review in a while. Mostly I\u0026#39;ve been trying to finish Persona 4 Golden, which has been a much longer endeavor than I thought. It has taken over and I haven\u0026#39;t even been playing \u0026#34;No Man\u0026#39;s Sky\u0026#34;. I do manage to play through some VNs though and I\u0026#39;m hoping to finish one or two of those soon. I wouldn\u0026#39;t mind putting up so reviews for those for you all to check out, so maybe that section will stop collecting dust soon.\nI didn\u0026#39;t do much in Persona 4 Golden yet this week, but, with the holiday coming, I\u0026#39;ll have some more time, so maybe you\u0026#39;ll see more in the guide. Remember, I have split it into two parts, all new stuff will go in the second part. The first part is basically done until I go back and fill in the early stuff after I\u0026#39;m done with this playthrough.\nCommissions I mentioned last week that I finished a couple commissions. Because I hadn\u0026#39;t delivered the final pieces to the client by the time that update went through, I wasn\u0026#39;t able to put them up here yet. Well I have delivered the finals to the client and am now able to post them here. Check out my commissions gallery for new additions! Have a very happy Turkey Day!\n","description":"","id":16,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","commissions","holiday"],"title":"Happy Turkey Day ü¶É","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/happy-turkey-day/"},{"content":" This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I\u0026#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun‚Ä¶as long as you ignore the last heading that is üòú\nNew Position As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology. Previously I was working as an ABA therapist. This work was fun, but it was also beginning to be too much. I was having difficulty focusing on my client\u0026#39;s needs and my schoolwork. So, I decided to leave.\nWell now I am a graduate assistant at the university and I will be supporting fellow doctoral learners. I\u0026#39;m excited for this position as it will give me experience teaching adults which I hope I can use in my future career as a professor. I just hope it will also help me develop a comfort for speaking and working with others, because that\u0026#39;s a problem for me üòÖ Of course I get to work in the comfort of my room, with all my stuffies, so I think that\u0026#39;ll help to get me started.\nNew Commission During this transition I had, sadly, lost some income. That was the really nice part of working where I was working. Fortunately, I have a very understanding friend who helped me by commissioning me. Sadly, this isn\u0026#39;t finalized yet so I was not able to publish it here before this update. It\u0026#39;ll be up by the next update. I actually did two pieces that I hope they can use for streaming.\nI always seem to do better when I\u0026#39;m drawing for someone then when I\u0026#39;m drawing for myself üòÖ I\u0026#39;m more motivated not just to draw but to draw well. Its also a lot of fun, so I\u0026#39;d like to get more. If you have any thing you want me to draw just head over to my commission page for more information on what I\u0026#39;m willing to draw and how to contact me for a commission, and check out my gallery for examples of my work!.\nBTW, I Hate Windows! I\u0026#39;m going to start by saying all of my work (training tasks, school work, art commissions, etc.) is done on a Mac. I mostly play games on my Steam Deck, however, I still have a Windows PC set up because of a small handful of games I can\u0026#39;t play on the Steam Deck or the Mac. Problem is, I\u0026#39;ve been having issues with updating that system. Twice now Windows has borked itself from an update. I\u0026#39;m facing the prospect of having to completely reinstall Windows for a second time, and I\u0026#39;m not liking that. I don\u0026#39;t have problems like this with macOS or SteamOS. Those updates usually just work. It\u0026#39;s only Windows. I won\u0026#39;t drop windows because I still want to play these games, but I really don\u0026#39;t like to mess with things. I guess that\u0026#39;s why I\u0026#39;m primarily a Mac gal. I\u0026#39;m going to ask anyone in the comments to share their Windows horror stories so I\u0026#39;m know I\u0026#39;m not alone.\n","description":"","id":17,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","commissions"],"title":"Fun Art Is Fun","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/fun-art-is-fun/"},{"content":" This site now has a lot of news articles! I guess one article each week for almost a year will do that. As a result, I made a few changes to how the news section is organized. You probably won\u0026#39;t notice anything, unless you link to an article. Sorry for all the links I just broke üòÖ\nWhat Changed!? All articles in this section used to just be in the \u0026#39;news\u0026#39; folder with the date as the file name. So, in the old way this article would have just been news/2023-11-09/. If you look in your URL bar though you should see something like news/2023/new-news/. This means that, more consistent with other pages on the site, the file name is now based on the title of the article and articles from 2023 are in one folder while articles from 2022 are in another folder. As I said, it won\u0026#39;t effect much as the index page will still basically look the same, but it will effect links, so keep that in mind! Once again, I do apologize for breaking any of those, but this will help keep the site source more organized for me.\nRE[BASE] Episode 5 is out! I apologize for the delay in getting this episode out. It is finally out now and I\u0026#39;m hoping it was worth the wait. It is going to help establish the story and direct things for the rest of the plot, though it might not seem that way just yet. Trust me, you\u0026#39;re going to want to read it though, if you are following RE[BASE] at all.\nMore is Coming! While I still haven\u0026#39;t started any RE[BASE] illustrations, I am working on something else. I had a fun idea come to my mind during a friend\u0026#39;s live stream and I am making that now. I\u0026#39;ll do RE[BASE] stuff soon. Its been a bit since I last drew anything though so this is a nice change. I\u0026#39;m also busy with work and school, but I am still managing everything. I even made sure this article came out on time. Yes, I\u0026#39;m proud of myself again. I do have to apologize again, is that the third time in one article, this news article is going to be a little shorter than some. A lot happened this week, but not a lot of it was worth noting and some of it is just laying down some ground work for future updates and things. Hopefully next week\u0026#39;s article will be a bit longer.\n","description":"","id":18,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"New News","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/new-news/"},{"content":" The month of October, also known as Spooky Month, is over. Halloween was one of my favorite holidays, but I, sadly, didn\u0026#39;t do much this year. I am still sad to see the month go and, I was also reminded, there are only two months left in the year üò≤. 2023 has gone by fast, huh?\nObligatory RE[BASE] update For reasons I\u0026#39;ll get into a bit later, you will not be seeing a new episode of RE[BASE] this week. Episode 5 will actually be a spooky day episode, but, no worries its not scary and not too late for a spooky day episode. I\u0026#39;m just said I didn\u0026#39;t have the idea until spooky day and I\u0026#39;ve been busy since so I didn\u0026#39;t have much time to write. Now the episode will be about a week late, sorry for that. It\u0026#39;ll be worth the wait though, I hope.\nNew Responsibilities As well as being a full time student working on a PhD in Psychology, I had been working as an ABA therapist. I had quit that job at the start of my residency last quarter and was focusing on my studies. While I loved my clients, it was getting to be too much for me. However, I started a new job this week that I hope will help me gain the type of experience I can use in my future career. This is a new job as a graduate assistant supporting the learners at my university! I\u0026#39;m a bit nervous because, part of the job means conducting one-on-one and group tutoring sessions. I\u0026#39;m also excited though!\nHowever, the new responsibilities of this job have left me with a bit less time. In fact my mother\u0026#39;s birthday and a meeting is the reason I didn\u0026#39;t make as much progress as I wanted to on episode 5 of RE[BASE], which I did start on Halloween. I\u0026#39;m excited for the new change though.\nSpeaking of New Changes‚Ä¶ My host as run a forum using phpBB for awhile now, but no one really joins and we mostly just use the private messages to talk to each other. The forums that were linked on this site went there, but I decided that we can use GitHub discussions instead and have begun switching it up. I think I have caught most of the links, but let me know if I missed any. You have always needed a GitHub account to comment on the pages, but will now also need one for discussions. I think this is better than requiring one account for the forums and then another account for comments. They can all be done with one account now!\nThis week I also finished part one of my P4G Walkthrough. I just finished it so you won\u0026#39;t see part two up yet. Soon though, part two will be there so don\u0026#39;t be surprised. Also, I\u0026#39;m keeping the title as is until the second part is up, but you will be able to tell part one from two when the second part goes up!\n","description":"","id":19,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"Spooky Month is Over üò¢","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/spooky-month-is-over/"},{"content":" Just kidding, I discovered those a long time ago üòù Actually, what\u0026#39;s funny is that some of my favorite JRPGS are also marked as visual novels, at least according to Steam. For some of them I can actually see that. Like Hyper Dimension Neptunia, or Fairy Fencer. Those do have some RPG elements to them, like building and leveling your characters and exploring dungeons, but most of the story is delivered in the same fashion as a visual novel. In fact, I can kind of even see it with the Persona series since much of that story is delivered in the same fashion. Sure both 4 and 5 also had some full motion scenes too, but those were kind of few. So, I guess I kind of like visual novels, though I am a bit disappointed in how similar say Neptunia and Fairy Fencer play even though the stories are so different.\nSome ADVENTURES in VNs! You maybe have noticed that the past couple of weeks these were actually written a day early! I was kind of proud of myself for that. Of course you might also notice that this one is not being written a day early üòÖ Well that\u0026#39;s because I found a translated VN that I\u0026#39;ve always wanted to get my hands on and may, or may not have, started playing it late at night when I should have been sleeping.\nThis VN is „Å≤„Åê„Çâ„Åó„ÅÆ„Å™„ÅèÈ†É„Å´ (officially translated as Higurashi When They Cry). When I was attended my first year at university, I discovered the anime adaptation and downloaded the entire series fansubbed. I still have those fansubs. This was before an official translation was even announced. Naturally, I discovered this was originally a visual novel, but, at the time, that was obviously not translated. You should know, by the state of the Japanese version of this site, that I\u0026#39;m not very good at Japanese, and this would have required a LOT of reading, so I just stuck to my fan translations of the anime.\nFast forward to two days ago and I was looking to see what kind of visual novels were available on Steam. I was just curious, wasn\u0026#39;t looking to buy anything. I came across one though that caught my eye as it had \u0026#34;When they Cry\u0026#34; in the title. I looked, and it was by the same developer of Higurashi. That\u0026#39;s when I decided to have a look at their developer page on Steam and discovered that they had translations up for what appears to be most if not all of the VNs of Higurashi! I was very excited, but even more excited when I found out that the first chapter, just like when they first released it, was still free. I downloaded it and started playing it late a few nights ago and may have stayed up a little late last night playing it too. Even better than it being free is that it has entirely new character sprites, which appear to be drawn by the character designer from the latest anime OVAs!\nI may have also downloaded and started playing a few more‚Ä¶embarrassing VNs that were floating around my library already and may or may not have also started playing those a little late at night too üòÖ\nEpisode 4! Of course I did managed to wake up at some pretty okay times even though a stayed up late and I wasn\u0026#39;t too tired yesterday. The day before was a bit rough though, not going to lie. I also didn\u0026#39;t have much to do after school hours, so I started Episode 4 of RE[BASE]. I plan on releasing it when this comes out, but, as I am writing this, I\u0026#39;m not quite done with it and it still needs proofing. If it isn\u0026#39;t there now, looked forward to it next week. If it is, then I\u0026#39;ll take my head pats please!\nThis episode is inspired by a kind of lonely weekend I just recently had, but also a bit of what I went through during COVID times. Don\u0026#39;t worry though, RE[BASE] is still pretty lighthearted, at least it is for now. I can promise things will be different, just don\u0026#39;t know when. Actually, that is something RE[BASE] has in common with Higurashi, they both start lighthearted, and then change. I can\u0026#39;t say if RE[BASE] is going to get nearly as dark as Higurashi, but it will be different than it is right now, right now!\nThere can be only one! I don\u0026#39;t know if I mentioned this before, but I usually let one game consume everything I play until I finish it. I would like to be able to play more than one game at-a-time and praise myself when I\u0026#39;m able to hold two or more games at once, but that usually doesn\u0026#39;t last long. Hopefully, I\u0026#39;ll get back to Persona 4 soon even though I do now have three VNs that I am working through again. I am only about halfway through Persona 4 Golden and would like to finally finish it soon. There will be an update to the walkthrough this week though, and with any luck, there will be one next week too!\n","description":"","id":20,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"I Hath Discovered Visual Novels!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/i-hath-discovered-visual-novels/"},{"content":" I guess I\u0026#39;ll start with a confession. There will be no episode of RE[BASE] this week. I\u0026#39;d like to point out that I said that I won\u0026#39;t necessarily be trying to maintain the once-a-week pace for episode releases. I also mentioned that releasing the first three episodes on that schedule was more because I was on break and had a lot of time. So, I would like to say its because I started back in classes so I don\u0026#39;t have the time I did when I was on break, but that\u0026#39;s not really true üòÖ\nThis week, in school, I did‚Ä¶ Nothing! Okay not exactly true. I did things. I read and I participated in discussions, but the reading was pretty light week one, and almost non-existent this week. Technically, I\u0026#39;m in week two, by the way. So, my school work really didn\u0026#39;t get in the way of my writing. In fact, I probably spent about three hours on school work last week and maybe two and half thus far this week üòÖ Now it\u0026#39;s not that I\u0026#39;m not as diligent as I was and I\u0026#39;m certainly not feeling lazy, but I just don\u0026#39;t have much to do in school. That\u0026#39;s just the fact thus far. Maybe things will pick up in week three or four, but so far, not much going on.\nThis week, in gaming‚Ä¶ I\u0026#39;ve been playing Persona 4 Golden! In fact, I\u0026#39;ve been playing that a LOT. Like maybe a bit too much. All that time not working on school work, yeah I spent that playing Persona or watching other people play games, like my friend on Twitch. Oh I\u0026#39;ve also been leveling a new character in Fiesta and working on some of my other characters, so yeah this is probably where most of my time is spent üòÖ\nBalance In short, I\u0026#39;m still having a little bit of trouble finding balance in my life üòÖ I\u0026#39;m much better than I was a few weeks ago and I\u0026#39;m still taken time to write this article and plan on spending time working on episode four of RE[BASE], that might not be until the weekend, but I\u0026#39;ve gone from being lazy to just redirecting my energy to games. I will say one thing though, I know my creativity suffers if I try to force myself to work on a project, so I\u0026#39;m not going to do that. I will need to find other ways of motivating myself to actually get it done. Mayhap the first step will be to ensure I know what the next episode will be about. Having a clear idea of how I want to start it, I think, will really help get things flowing and make me want to write. Anyway, I am still a work in progress, so bear with me. Also, I plan on starting some illustrations the weekend. Hopefully you\u0026#39;ll see them in a few weeks!\n","description":"","id":21,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"A Little Too Much Gaming?","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/a-little-too-much-gaming/"},{"content":" Breaks always seem to go by way too fast. I mean I get three weeks between terms, but those same three weeks always seem to go by faster and faster. Fortunately, the first couple weeks of a new term are always fairly light so I don\u0026#39;t have to worry so much right away. This week has been light enough that I\u0026#39;ve been able to do a lot of extra things. I haven\u0026#39;t quite put together a full character sheet for Allana yet, so I don\u0026#39;t really want to show her off, but I have made a lot of progress on her third episode, it should be ready by the time this goes up and I\u0026#39;ve made some more progress in Persona 4, there will be more in the walkthrough when this goes up too!\nWriting a little early Right now I\u0026#39;m watching a friend streaming on Twitch. Seeing as its pretty calm and I don\u0026#39;t have much homework to do, I figured I\u0026#39;d get a jump on this news article. You\u0026#39;ll note the date is one day before it is going up! Remember, site updates are always up on Thursdays, so the dates don\u0026#39;t always match when new content is available. This is especially important with my ADVENTURES since I usually start those at least a week before they are released. In fact, I have a friend who watches my RSS feeds (if you have an RSS feed aggregator, please subscribe to my feeds for immediate updates) and he got a little confused when the stories were released because his aggregator displays them by the date reported and unread pages, mostly the stories, would come up below things he knew he read. So now everyone gets a warning. This will happen, especially with the stories! The dates on pages is their creation date, that\u0026#39;s the date I first started writing them. Keep that in mind!\nMore writing! As I mentioned episode three of RE[BASE] should be out by the time this is released. I hope, by writing this a day before, I don\u0026#39;t end up making a liar out of myself :sweatdrop: I\u0026#39;ve been having a lot of fun writing these little stories. Now that it is almost the middle of October, I don\u0026#39;t know if I\u0026#39;ll make the progress I wanted to on them, but I have plans if I can\u0026#39;t. I\u0026#39;m not really holding myself to any particular release schedule. I\u0026#39;ve so far managed one episode a week, but I\u0026#39;m not sure if that\u0026#39;ll keep up. So far I haven\u0026#39;t suffered from any writer\u0026#39;s block, just a mild case of lack of motivation, which I managed to overcome pretty quickly. Well, if I\u0026#39;m not a liar, than you\u0026#39;ll have another episode to read! This one is looking to be a little longer than the other two, but it\u0026#39;ll hopefully be just as entertaining if not more so!\nMore playing! I\u0026#39;ve mostly been watching my friend\u0026#39;s livestreams, but I do managed to play video games some times. I\u0026#39;m not nearly up to where I was before my last term, but I am playing Persona 4 Golden again. I\u0026#39;m currently trying to get to the next part in the game. I\u0026#39;ve managed to get the guide caught up though. By the time this goes up I should be about done with the summer break activities and almost to the next part. I\u0026#39;m thinking of splitting the walkthrough though. As it is now it is pretty hard to navigate even with the navigation tree on the right of the page (that is getting so long you have to scroll it independent of the page). So I\u0026#39;m thinking either of putting each dungeon into its own chapter, or splitting it by break. As you know I don\u0026#39;t yet have the first part of the walkthrough since I kind of started it late. So it will be the pre-spring break part that will go up later, maybe during a second playthrough, then the spring to summer break sections and then the summer break to winter break sections. Right now, it\u0026#39;ll all stay in one place though. I\u0026#39;ll think about splitting it after I start the first section again.\nLess laziness! I\u0026#39;m proud of my progress this week. I think I battle my laziness and won! At least I did this week. I\u0026#39;ve been trying to get up and get everything ready at least an hour before school work and making sure I\u0026#39;m not in bed too early or too late. I think this has helped me stay focused and alert so far.

To be fair to myself, I have made progress on all of projects and completed many a to-do item, but I really had to force myself to do some of them. I actually finished episode two of RE[BASE] sometime just after I published the first episode so that will be going up this week. I even started episode three, but I didn\u0026#39;t make as much progress as I wanted and I haven\u0026#39;t played the games I wanted to play this week either. I still need to finish my Persona 4 playthrough so I can get the guide done. I\u0026#39;m only halfway through, I think.\nI can do it! First, I think I should acknowledge that I did things! I might be feeling lazy, but the truth is I didn\u0026#39;t just sit around like a sloth. I mean, I did spend far too much time in/on my bed, but I got out of it and worked. So I have to acknowledge that things got done, and that\u0026#39;s good.

I could have finished both Allana\u0026#39;s design and her first outfit. I could have made more progress on episode 3 of RE[BASE] and I could have written a longer news article. I also could have worked a little bit more on the Persona 4 guide. These things didn\u0026#39;t happen this week.\nI don\u0026#39;t really know why I have been wanting to stay in bed more. Maybe its the cooler temperatures luring me to stay under the warm, cozy comforter, or maybe its that I\u0026#39;ve had a lot on my mind and its been weighing on me too much. Either way I\u0026#39;ve not been wanting to get out of bed and start working and that as pushed a lot of things around to where they shouldn\u0026#39;t be. I\u0026#39;ve kept myself in check so far, but I\u0026#39;ll have to keep monitoring myself and making sure things get done.

This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I\u0026#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I\u0026#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don\u0026#39;t tell anyone.\nCelebration time ü•≥ My friend, and first client, has just reached affiliate on Twitch! Actually, I am watching them stream as I\u0026#39;m writing this. They are also about to reach 100 followers and its been great cheering them on. Of course it is also great seeing my art on every stream. My little Jade is really getting out there! If you have some time why not hop over to Jade\u0026#39;s twitch page and give them a follow. If I\u0026#39;m lucky they\u0026#39;ll be able to commission me some more with a few more subscribers or followers, so do check them out!\nDrawing for other people While I have also spent time working on some of my own projects, mostly just designing new characters for RE[BASE], I find it far more interesting and easier to draw for other people. I don\u0026#39;t know if I get some sort of reward from it, or what, but I do like it. In fact I\u0026#39;m working on a bit of a surprise for someone. They aren\u0026#39;t even paying me and I enjoy it far more than working on anything I started for myself. I think this is why I really want more commissions.\nRE[BASE] Update RE[BASE] Episode 1 is officially out today! I have also started the second episode and it should be out next week. I\u0026#39;m not sure if I\u0026#39;m going to be able to release an episode every week, but I\u0026#39;ll try at least during break. Should be you\u0026#39;ll have three episodes up to read just in case things slow down during my next quarter.\nOf course, the short stories aren\u0026#39;t all I plan on releasing. I am designing the characters too and you\u0026#39;ll see them in my peektures, but I am also hoping to illustrate parts of the story. For this I would like to incorporate them in the actual story, maybe one at the beginning and a few peppered in between paragraphs. Not really sure how I\u0026#39;ll do it just yet, but you\u0026#39;ll see as they come out. As I mentioned last week, I won\u0026#39;t be waiting for these illustrations to release episodes, but its likely that they will come out fairly frequently during the next quarter. It is usually easier for me to find time to draw than write. Just check back old episodes every now-and-then to see new art.\nIf you have any comments on the story, don\u0026#39;t hesitate to let me know. You can comment on the pages themselves, or use any of the links at the bottom to reach me, including the forum. Thank you! Hope you enjoy the new story!\n","description":"","id":24,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","rebase","allana"],"title":"RE[BASE] is Up!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/rebase-is-up/"},{"content":" During my break I decided to do some productive things instead of just playing video games. I mean I do that too, but not just that üòù One of those new things is getting back in to creative writing. While this week\u0026#39;s update likely won\u0026#39;t feature it, I have started a new series of short stories. Of course I\u0026#39;m also now about halfway through Persona 4 Golden so I\u0026#39;ve been updating my guide for that finally!\nMore progress means beeger walkthrough! First, I have made more progress in Persona 4 Golden. I\u0026#39;ve gotten through July and the beginning of August. I believe this will put me around the halfway mark as I believe the game goes through one full calendar year. Now I am not really focusing on quests at the moment, so that part of the guide is still not there, I am also only focusing on some club activities and jobs, so the social link guides will also come later. Okay, if I\u0026#39;m honest, right now, all that I have been working on is the general walkthrough. I am working on Nanako\u0026#39;s Social Link as well, but have reached a bit of a snag due to early game laziness. Once I\u0026#39;m able to progress, I think I\u0026#39;ll write a bit on that so that people can avoid the mistakes I made and, I\u0026#39;ll hopefully get more information up on other social links and clubs and jobs and how to combine the two. For now though, enjoy the walkthrough. I\u0026#39;ll probably have to break it up at some point as it is getting to be pretty long, but I\u0026#39;ll worry about that later üòÖ\nNew ADVENTURE! I am actually using Hugo\u0026#39;s draft capabilities! Normally, I just leave the draft variable set to false because I write and proofread new guide additions, peektures, and news articles within the week. This means that most new additions are finished before the next update. This doesn\u0026#39;t seem to be the case for my stories though. They\u0026#39;ll take a little longer, so I have set the first one to draft and it won\u0026#39;t show up just yet. I\u0026#39;ll give you a bit of a sneakpeek though.\nRE[BASE] The new ADVENTURE is called RE[BASE] and will follow the cute adventures of a thirteen year-old girl named Allana who is an avid gamer. For reasons that will be explained in the story, Allana now spends most of her time at home with her sister, Trista, playing MMO\u0026#39;s and chatting to friends on Discord. Occasionally her friends come over to hang out and antics ensue. It\u0026#39;s meant to be a kind of \u0026#34;slice of life\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;cute girls doing cute things\u0026#34; kind of story that takes my quarantine experience from when I had COVID as well as the experience of what it was like when COVID first started and blows it up.\nRE[BASE]/Format While there is an overarching story, and some potential pitfalls and plot twists. Each episode will be designed as a short story with self-contained plots. I\u0026#39;m doing this because I noticed that I tend to give up pretty early in my stories, so I\u0026#39;m hoping a series of short stories would be more manageable, plus, if I don\u0026#39;t get to certain parts, it\u0026#39;ll be okay because you could just enjoy the individual little stories.\nRE[BASE]/Pictures Though I will be changing draft to false as soon as a story is completed, ensuring availability as soon as I publish the next week\u0026#39;s updates, I plan on illustrating parts of the story. These illustrations will be added as they are completed. I don\u0026#39;t want to hold back a story because I\u0026#39;m waiting to finish a drawing. Please keep checking back, and checking my galleries, so you don\u0026#39;t miss the illustrations!\nBreak I have completed my first residency and am currently on break! ü•≥ I\u0026#39;ve been using my time for writing, playing video games, and watching anime. Its been nice to have the time to work on hobbies. Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll throw some drawing in there too before break is over. Not looking forward to my next class, but I\u0026#39;m hoping to do well. Look forward to new art, new stories, and more updates to guides over the next couple of weeks!\n","description":"","id":25,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"New ADVENTURE Series!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/new-adventure-series/"},{"content":" Hello!\nI come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in üòÜ Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying \u0026#34;Why can\u0026#39;t I keep it going!?\u0026#34; and get all depressed, so I won\u0026#39;t do that. I\u0026#39;ll just continue to be happy that I make an effort every week to at least post a news article!\nSleeping Habits! Yep I\u0026#39;m just going to jump over here without a single transition sentence cuz, weee, it\u0026#39;s fun! So sleeping habits, mine suck! I don\u0026#39;t know why. I think sleep is important and I know I feel much better when I get at least seven hours of actual sleep, not just laying in bed. I even went through the trouble of getting an Apple Watch SE so I could track my sleep more accurately. Guess what? It works! But, remember that sentence in the other paragraph about me saying \u0026#34;Why can\u0026#39;t I keep it going!?\u0026#34; Well, that applies to my sleep too.\nWhen I was working part time and going to doctoral-level classes at full time (I don\u0026#39;t suggest doing that, especially if your part time job is very demanding and you end up with almost full time hours), I always said, oh I am working to much, that\u0026#39;s why I\u0026#39;m not getting enough sleep. So I quit my job and everything worked out. All done! I get good girl head pats now, right? Wrong!\nOh, I was doing suuuper good for awhile. Yep always getting at least seven and a half hours of sleep and feeling great. Went from needing a energy drink in the middle of the day to not needing anything. Unfortunately, it didn\u0026#39;t last. At some point I noticed that, although I was getting enough sleep, and it felt great not waking up to an alarm, I was starting to get up later and later. I totally didn\u0026#39;t want to be one of those who didn\u0026#39;t wake up until noon, even if my school schedule would allow it. So I threatened to set myself an alarm again. Now I have been waking up no later than eight, which is kind of good, except for the fact that I have been getting less than seven hours and feeling sluggish and needing energy drinks again üòî Now I feel dejected because I am not getting enough sleep and asking \u0026#34;Why can\u0026#39;t I keep it going!?\u0026#34; again. This time with no answer. Actually, I\u0026#39;d say, because I played over three hours of Holocure and didn\u0026#39;t get to bed until one, I\u0026#39;d say that, except that was last night and I actually was only minutes from my goal that night. Anyway, I\u0026#39;ll try to do better, but that is not why there is no content updates this week üòù\nSignature Assignment At the beginning of this quarter I started my first of three virtual residencies to prepare for my doctoral dissertation. This has been an interesting course and has helped me a lot in settling on a actionable research topic for my dissertation. In the course of this course I have done a lot of research, to the point that, I think I know just about everything you can know about one specific topic üòÜ I also did a lot of writing. This week has been, and continues to be, very busy as it is the last week of this residency. That means I have a signature assignment due that goes over the particulars of my topic and outlines the research I plan on doing. At the time I\u0026#39;m writing this, it is about 77% done. Just a few finishing touches, really. I have spent my week on it though. This is the main reason there is no content updates this week.\nHow About Next Week? Well, there is a big chance there will be more content updates next week. I have an idea for another short story that I would like to write and, as I said, this is the last week of my first residency. I get a short break between this and my next course, so I\u0026#39;ll have time to work on more creative things. Maybe I\u0026#39;ll also finish another drawing. Either way you\u0026#39;ll have some thing to look forward to next week. For now, I hope you are satisfied with this one, rather long, news article!\n","description":"","id":26,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Busy Week","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/busy-week/"},{"content":" Well, as of writing this I am still technically writing a thing. I started it thought so, yeah‚Ä¶üòÜ Anyway, aside from writing a new ADVENTURE, I also made a few more adjustments to my fiesta leveling guide. This week though it is mostly about writing!\nAbout the adjustments After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides. It seemed like all the guides were kind of just in whatever order they were created or something and that made it a bit difficult for me to find the write guide. They should all be in the right order though. Babies on top all the way to God-like Adventurer\u0026#39;s at the bottom. Of course the level range for each guide is still available in its description so you\u0026#39;ll know which guide to open based on what level your characters are.\nOnce a guide is open you can use the list on the side to find your level and find what rep or set of quests to do. Speaking of this, back when I wrote the guides in Markdown, I started all the headers at a second level so the title of the page could be the first. This is not needed anymore because the Hugo template handles that. I finally went through and adjusted all the headers so they are correct now.\nFinally, I made a noted on the fledgling adventure guide that you can still do gargoyles up until 91 and even gave a strategy on doing both RS and gargoyles at the same time, if you want. Personally I found it difficult, but that was probably because I was juggling the quest and killing at the same time. If you have a friend to keel for you, it will probably work out better.\nNew ADVENTURE Technically, as of right now, I am still writing this, but I wanted to go ahead and talk about it now. It should be available the same time this news articles goes up anyway. I was inspired by my friends and the changing of the seasons so I wrote (or am writing) a little short story about BabyYayo, one of my Fiesta characters. She going back to school. I hope you like it. If you have a GitHub account, don\u0026#39;t hesitate to comment on it! If you don\u0026#39;t have a GitHub account you can still let me know through my socials linked at the bottom of this page! Now I am going to head over and finished hat story! Gotta make sure it goes up with this article after all üòÑ\n","description":"","id":27,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"I wrote a thing!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/i-wrote-a-thing/"},{"content":" BabyYayo and Yayoi_chi sit on the beach at Sand Beach. They look out at the sun. Yayoi_chi can already tell that the days are getting shorter, but the pair sit in silence, wearing their kimono hoping to catch a glance of fireworks. Even with the shorter days, it is still far too early. \u0026#34;The days are really getting shorter, huh?\u0026#34; Baby asks, breaking the silence like a distant wave.\nYayoi_chi stretches an arm around her younger sister. She draws her in close, like a mother bird protecting her child. \u0026#34;The are,\u0026#34; she says almost dreamily, wondering when Baby will grow too old for this kind of embrace and hoping it isn\u0026#39;t too soon. Then a devious smile flashes over Yayoi\u0026#39;s lips \u0026#34;You know what that means, right?\u0026#34; she asks.\n\u0026#34;No,\u0026#34; Baby looks into her sister\u0026#39;s eyes trying to figure out what she was thinking all of a sudden.\nYayoi\u0026#39;s smile turn to a rather frightening grin. \u0026#34;Its time for you to go back to school!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I guess,\u0026#34; Baby said, still unsure of her sister\u0026#39;s intentions.\nYayoi grabbed her sister\u0026#39;s hands forcefully! \u0026#34;Time to get you ready!\u0026#34;\nIt donned on Baby just what her sister had planned for her, and she wasn\u0026#39;t entirely sure she liked it!\nYayoi\u0026#39;s devious plot! Before Baby was even sure what was happening she was on her feet and heading away from the beach. She looked back longingly \u0026#34;But what about the fireworks,\u0026#34; she said quietly. If her sister heard her, she certainly didn\u0026#39;t listen, because the pair were soon on their little matching Chirpys and headed back to Roumen.\n\u0026#34;School supplies, school supplies,\u0026#34; Yayoi breathed as she literally dragged her sister by the hand through the upper road of Roumen, \u0026#34;Who would sell school supplies?\u0026#34; In the distance she spotted Skill Master Ruby. \u0026#34;Surely a skill master would know something about school supplies!\u0026#34; she thought aloud.\nYayoi dragged her sister over to the skill master. \u0026#34;Oh hi there sweeties,\u0026#34; the master greeted. She still remember selling skill scrolls to Yayoi_chi back when she was younger, as well as selling some to Baby. \u0026#34;My Baby, you have grown!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What about me?\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi asked. For the longest time, it seemed she was stuck in her training, but, recently, she felt she had grown quite a bit as an ADVENTURER.\n\u0026#34;You too, darling,\u0026#34; Ruby added. Yayoi proudly placed her hands on her hips. \u0026#34;What can I do for you today? Surely you two have both outgrown my little shoppe!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know about that,\u0026#34; Yayoi said, trying to sound bashful, \u0026#34;but, you\u0026#39;re right, we aren\u0026#39;t here for skill scrolls. You see its time for Baby here to go back to school!\u0026#34;\nNot missing a beat, Ruby replied, \u0026#34;Congrats, dear, but what can I help you with?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I know it\u0026#39;s probably beneath a merchant of your stature to sell little things like school supplies, but I was wondering if you knew someone who did.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;As a matter of fact I‚Ä¶\u0026#34; Ruby started, \u0026#34;do not, but I hear the blacksmith might at least know where you could get her a uniform. That\u0026#39;s a start, no?\u0026#34;\nBabyYayo didn\u0026#39;t mind being dragged over to Ruby. She had learned a lot thanks to Ruby\u0026#39;s skill scrolls and Ruby was always nice to her. She especially liked how Ruby called her \u0026#34;sweetie\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;darling\u0026#34;. It really made her feel special somehow, even though she did that with just about everyone, at least as far as Baby was aware. The black smith, however, that was another story. Sure Baby got a lot of her gear from him, but never really liked dealing with him. She hid behind her sister as she asked, \u0026#34;So, I hear you have some information on where every student is getting their uniforms these days.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;And what if I do?\u0026#34; the man asked.\n\u0026#34;Well,\u0026#34; Yayoi said with a wink and a grin, \u0026#34;I might be able to make it worth your while if you told me.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh, come on now, we all know you\u0026#39;re broke,\u0026#34; the man said.\n\u0026#34;Hey!\u0026#34; Yayoi exclaimed. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll have you know I am not broke! I\u0026#39;m just saving a few gems for a rainy day!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Have you ever seen a drop of rain here lassy?\u0026#34; the grizzled black smith questioned.\n\u0026#34;No, but that doesn\u0026#39;t matter, it could rain!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sure‚Ä¶\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Well, I can make it worth your while, so are you going to tell me where I can get my sister a uniform?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Your sister? Oh, is this for the cutey behind you? Why didn\u0026#39;t you say so? But I don\u0026#39;t exactly know where you can buy her a uniform.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;But‚Ä¶\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I said I didn\u0026#39;t know exactly, but I can give you an idea.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay?\u0026#34; Yayoi prompted.\n\u0026#34;Two letter, A and R\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;AR, what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u0026#34; Yayoi asked. The blacksmith made a motion like he was a mime zipping is lips closed. \u0026#34;Fine, don\u0026#39;t tell me! Come on, Baby, we\u0026#39;re leaving!\u0026#34; Baby couldn\u0026#39;t say she was sad to go. The man was still giving her a creepy look.\nYayoi\u0026#39;s surprise! \u0026#34;Abestol Ruins,\u0026#34; Baby suddenly called out as Yayoi dragged her toward the teleport gate in Roumen.\n\u0026#34;What?\u0026#34; Yayoi asked.\n\u0026#34;A and R,\u0026#34; Baby explained, \u0026#34;A is Abestol and R is Ruins!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What a smart sister I have!\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi exclaimed. She set their destination for Abestol Ruins and soon they were in the small village. \u0026#34;But don\u0026#39;t think this means you get to skip school!\u0026#34; the girl added. Baby sighed, it seemed that even her adventuring wouldn\u0026#39;t save her from school. Of course, she knew all to well just how stubborn her sister could be.\nAfter asking around for a bit, the pair finally found where to pick up a uniform and school supplies. Baby was feeling very encumbered as she carried all of the new supplies in the few bags she had. As she tried to juggle have everything, her sister took her by the shoulder. \u0026#34;I have a surprise,\u0026#34; she said with a wink. What now? Baby wondered.\nYayoi_chi stopped by the storage keeper. She let go of her sister\u0026#39;s hands. \u0026#34;Wait here,\u0026#34; she said with another wink. Baby let out a sigh and watched as her sister chatted with the storage keeper for a few minutes. Fortunately, she was gone too long. \u0026#34;All set,\u0026#34; the older sister said, \u0026#34;let\u0026#39;s get you into your uniform.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What!?\u0026#34; BabyYayo complained, \u0026#34;Now!?\u0026#34; Yayoi nodded while she pushed her sister off into one of the nearby buildings. She found a quiet room and handed her younger sister the uniform they just purchased.\nDid you think I\u0026#39;d make you go alone? BabyYayo put on the uniform and stepped out of the private room her sister had found. She expected to see her sister, but Yayoi_chi was no where to be seen. \u0026#34;Did she leave me here?\u0026#34; the girl asked. She plopped herself on a nearby bench, only to stand right back up at the slightest sound of a door opening. It was her sister and she was also wearing a school uniform. \u0026#34;Oneechan!\u0026#34; Baby called.\n\u0026#34;I never said you\u0026#39;d be going to school alone,\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi stated.\n\u0026#34;Oneechan,\u0026#34; Baby said with a smile.\n\u0026#34;Now we can be partners in school ADVENTURES!\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi proclaimed.\n\u0026#34;Onee~~chan!!\u0026#34; Baby shouted!\n-Fin-\n","description":"","id":28,"section":"adventures","tags":[],"title":"Baby Goes Back 2 School","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/baby-back2school/"},{"content":" This was originally going to be called, \u0026#34;More about commission\u0026#34;, but I didn\u0026#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week\u0026#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!\nI want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe. Anyway, I know I mentioned them a little bit in the last news article, but I felt that I didn\u0026#39;t really give them enough attention, so I added a dedicated page that talks about them in a bit more detail. This includes things I feel I\u0026#39;m good at and am more than willing to draw for you as well as things I absolutely won\u0026#39;t draw. I also go into more detail on how to get a hold of me and how payments are likely to work. This was only one addition though.\nNew gallery section! I decided that it would be best to showcase commissions that I have permission to showcase sperately from other art work of mine. For that reason, I created a new gallery section for commissions specifically. I know that\u0026#39;s a LOT of commisssion-related things, but I really like doing them!\nMore Fiesta stuff I\u0026#39;ve been playing a lot more Fiesta Online. I haven\u0026#39;t discovered anything odd about my guide since the last time, but I\u0026#39;m keeping my eyes opened. So far it hasn\u0026#39;t really inspired any new ADVENTURES either. Mostly I\u0026#39;ve just be leveling BabyYayo, my younger character. That gets a bit reptitive, but I\u0026#39;m hoping to have some ADVENTURES with her soon. I\u0026#39;ll keep you all posted.\nI have a fleet! Also I\u0026#39;ve been playing \u0026#34;No Man\u0026#39;s Sky\u0026#34; still. I\u0026#39;m actually surprpised. I mean I go over a lot of my surprises about the game itself it my firt impressions, but I\u0026#39;m also surprised that I\u0026#39;m playing two games at once still. I tend to drop old games whenever I start something new. As I mentioned though I have a fleet now and am really enjoying that aspect of the game. I\u0026#39;ll write more about that when I put together a full review later.\nThe streak continues Honestly, I wasn\u0026#39;t sure what I would say or do for the site this week until last night. I was worried I\u0026#39;d break my streak, but, as you can see, I have not. Hopefully I keep this site alive!

One thing is that I\u0026#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man\u0026#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn\u0026#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!\nAbout Commissions! After the success of my last commission, I have decided that I would like to do more of them. Once again I have to thank my friend for giving me the opportunity to work on commission. I have a forum post up where you can let me know you are interested in a commission. We can even start work shopping the idea in that thread or I\u0026#39;ll DM you.

At the moment pricing is done per project, but I will estimate everything for you! Thank you in advance!\nFirst, first impressions! I have also written my first impressions of No Man\u0026#39;s Sky. I wanted to, once again, say that these are just the first impressions, but I did put a star ranking up. I will write a full review when I have completed the main missions, but I\u0026#39;ll leave up my first impressions too. I think it would be really good to be able to compare how my thoughts change, if they do, when I finish the main story. As always you can comment on my review using either the comment box on the page or a forum post.\nThis is intentionally blank I kid, sort of. Normally I have three heading in each news article, but I didn\u0026#39;t really come up with three things. Thought that would make a funny heading, but than I ruined it by explaining it, huh? Or well. Let\u0026#39;s all start looking forward to next week and may more commissions! YAY!!\n","description":"Some stuff happened this week! One BEEG thing is that I am opening commissions!","id":31,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","announcement"],"title":"Commissions are OPEN!!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/commissions-are-open/"},{"content":" \u0026nbsp; First No Man\u0026#39;s Sky actually has a story! I know this came as a bit of a surprise to me too. Basically you are a Traveller and you wake up on a planet with no memory of how you got there, just your exosuit and your starship. You will go through and explore the world, build a base, and try to learn what happened to you. It is this last part that provides us with a surprisingly deep story that I was really not prepared for, but am pleasantly surprised is there!\nI\u0026#39;m going to start this off with a bit of a disclaimer. This page represents my first impressions of No Man\u0026#39;s Sky. I am, by no means, finished with the story. I wanted to get ahead of things though and give some first thoughts because of just how impressed I am with what I have played so far. There may be another page (one that will have the rating in the title like my other reviews) in the future that is more of a standard review, but on to my first impressions!\nOverall I am very impressed with the game so far. The visuals and art direction is great. The planets feel alive, if not a bit underwhelming in terms of diversity, and the gameplay is great! You are free to follow the story or just explore, or generally do whatever you want. You are hour own master and its pretty great. It reminds me of an MMO in this fashion. Which is probably why I like it so much. Of course being set in space and being able to explore all these new worlds is a real big bonus too even if the worlds to seem awfully close together.\nContent I can\u0026#39;t speak to the overall length of the game just yet and that might not matter. What I can say is that there does seem to be plenty of content available. There are tons of quests and side quests (or missions or whatever they like to call them here) and you pick up quite a few of the naturally just as you progress through the game. It can make it hard to prioritize things, but it also ensure you won\u0026#39;t be bored for quite a long time. I\u0026#39;m ten hours in already and can see I still have lots to do!.\nArt and Graphics This is both No Man\u0026#39;s Sky\u0026#39;s biggest strength and its weakness. The graphics and art direction are great. All the ships look good and look like they could actually exist, the stations are all kinda just spheres and the life forms are pretty interesting, but many planets seem to have only a couple of unique fauna, and that is a bummer. I understand that it may have been done to make exploring a bit less daunting, and may even be different for less \u0026#34;relaxed\u0026#34; players, but I do find myself wishing there were more types of animals as well as animals with fur, which I have yet to encounter. Also the seamless way you can change between space and planetary exploration is great, but also probably contributes to the overall small size of each star system. Still, its not terrible and at least I can understand why things were done the way they were.\nStory As I aluded to, this is where I was most impressed. Having heard about this game a long time ago, around when it was first announced, I figured it was just an open-ended exploration sandbox and, if it had a story, its story would be a low priority. I\u0026#39;ll say, this might have been the case back then, but it is not the case now. So far the story is very good and keeps me playing for‚Ä¶.mayhap too long‚Ä¶each play session. I have said before, I play games for the story. I quickly abandon things, like Slime Rancher, if the story is short, or boring. No Man\u0026#39;s Sky is none of those so I keep on going!\n","description":"No Man's Sky is a surprisingly deep journey of exploration.

I did play a new game, but I\u0026#39;m not to a point where I\u0026#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn\u0026#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.\nMinor corrections So, I\u0026#39;ve been leveling one of my characters in Fiesta. This gives me a good opportunity to make sure my guide is still up-to-date as I often don\u0026#39;t remember some things and I have to have the guide up anyway while I play. I noticed some minor corrections needed to be made specifically in the fledgling adventurer leveling guide. So, the only real site update this week was fixing that guide. It is still important though!\nCommission Accomplished! This week I also finished my commission! I\u0026#39;m really excited and today I even got to see it in action on the client\u0026#39;s site. Oh, also I guess there was a couple other little updates! First I placed the commission in my creations gallery check it out there, please! I also added some new wallpapers!\nCheck out Twitch! My commission was for a vTuber we are calling Jade! This vTuber streams over on Twitch. They mostly play retro games, but check it out when you can. I\u0026#39;m actually watching them play FFX as I write this!\n","description":"Not much happened this week, but I did do a thing!","id":33,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","friends"],"title":"A little week","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/a-little-week/"},{"content":" I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don\u0026#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I\u0026#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week\u0026#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I\u0026#39;m doing fairly good!\nA little witch! Little Witch Nobeta is a very good game. It is plagued with some story issues, but I did enjoy it. I also enjoyed writing my review. I hope you enjoy reading it. Don\u0026#39;t really have much else to say, except Nobeta is suuuper kyuute! Okay I said it!\nWeekly updates Even if it is just new content like a new review and a new news article, I am still updating this site weekly. So far I\u0026#39;ve been able to keep my deadline three weeks in a row, even though it was a little difficult this week. My commission is coming a long and its a lot of fun to draw it. I mean how many other jobs to you get to watch YouTube while you work üòú. I also enjoy drawing and I think I\u0026#39;m doing even better then I would if I wasn\u0026#39;t working for someone else. It does take a lot of time and I am also still working at school so I was pretty busy this week, but I still managed and I hope to continue to manage my weekly updates for a long time!\n","description":"I wrote a thing!","id":34,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Moar Reviews!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/moar-reviews/"},{"content":" \u0026nbsp; In Little Witch Nobeta you play as a little witch who lost her memory. She goes on a journey to the one place she remembers, a throne in a giant castle, in hopes of finding her memory. Along the way she meets a cat who is very insistent that she makes it to the throne!\nOverall If you like souls-like games and cute little girls, this game is for you! It isn\u0026#39;t just cute though there is a pretty nice, but somewhat predictable story and some pretty tough battles. Combat will get you if you aren\u0026#39;t prepared but there is one over-power spell that will likely carry you for most of the game as long as you remember it. This can be helpful but also makes the combat a bit‚Ä¶samey\nCombat At the beginning of the game combat can be a bit difficult and this game likes to through lots of enemies at you at once. With your first spell and only melee attacks it can get overwhelming. Fortunately, you start to feel very powerful pretty quickly as you gain spells and souls.\nPart of the fun of this game is upgrading your spells and your stats. As you upgrade these your begin to gain more and more power making you feel like a pretty awesome witch by the end of the game. Getting to that point can be challenging, but this challenge is also what makes this fun. You will be punished, but there will be a pay off.\nStory Honestly game play is great, combat is pretty awesome if not a bit challenging at first, the game is really fun, but it only has three stars, well, that\u0026#39;s because the story is‚Ä¶not so great. There is some interesting points, and I\u0026#39;ll admit I didn\u0026#39;t experience the entire story, but that\u0026#39;s part of the problem. Playing the game only gives you a part of the story. As you play you will again items, these items unlock little motion comics, but these can only be viewed once you complete the game and much of the story is locked in them. This makes for a pretty mediocre story during the game. Now, I mostly play games for the story so this might not be as important to others. It is something to be aware of though.\nStyle The style and art direction of the game is pretty nice. Nobeta and the other girls are very well designed and adorable. The game\u0026#39;s enemies are also nicely designed. Rooms and corridors are nice and there are some pretty cool areas. There is a little disconnect between all of these things though. It was almost like characters, maps, areas, and enemies were all designed by different people, yet it all does seem to work out pretty well in the end. Nobeta is cute and you\u0026#39;ll enjoy the game if you like her!\n","description":"Reviewing a cute game about a little loli witch that is cute!","id":35,"section":"reviews","tags":["review","cat","game","cute"],"title":"Little Witch Nobeta [3/5]","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/reviews/little-witch-nobeta/"},{"content":" Hello and welcome to another update!\nI like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I\u0026#39;m trying to achieve. This week, there is no new review, but I plan on writing one for Little Witch Nobeta fairly soon as I just completed that game. I didn\u0026#39;t do everything, but I did finish the main story so I feel qualified to review it now. You can look forward to that review in next week\u0026#39;s update!\nA friend\u0026#39;s ADVENTURE For this week, we have a new ADVENTURE added to the ADVENTURES section only I didn\u0026#39;t write it. That\u0026#39;s right I got permission from a friend, michelle.bsparkx to use a story she had posted on Discord. I really like the story and thought it would be a good fit for my ADVENTURES, it even inspired to write more short-form stories. I was suuper glad she let me post a copy for everyone here. I hope you like it.\nA commission Yep, this week\u0026#39;s news is all friend-related üòÜ. A different friend of mine is planning on streaming soon and would like an avatar to use during their streams. They asked me to design the a vTuber and I have started that right away. I was really excited to get commissioned and want to do my best. I just hope they like what I come up with for them. I will not be posting all of the drawings I come up with here, but I will, with their permission of course, be posting some of the completed designs. I hope I do a good job, there is one thing I\u0026#39;m a little worried about though, but hopefully it will be fine üòÖ.\nSupport? I was asked if I would like financial compensation for the above commission, for me a commission is any request where I get some form of compensation and there are other forms than just money, but this did get me thinking, I don\u0026#39;t like taking money from people directly, but maybe I can take money through donations or something. What do you think? I\u0026#39;ve put a poll up in my forums. There you can answer and give me comments and reasons that support your answer, thank you for helping!\n","description":"I'm being commissioned to design a vTuber avatar!

An idea hatched to create a character by the name of _Egg.\nFast-forward to the present: _Egg is dancing by one of her favourite little Elderine friends, Marionette Edge. Their bright attire and colourful hair stand out amongst the crowd. A passerby asks about the runic aura that surrounds them. \u0026#34;I got it from a Kingdom Quest some years ago, but it\u0026#39;s no longer available. \u0026#34; solemnly responds _Egg, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ve heard it\u0026#39;s supposed to make its way back someday, though I\u0026#39;m not sure when.\u0026#34;\nAfter responding to their query, Edge and _Egg wander off to meet a stray pig on the outskirts of Elderine. _Egg runs up to hug the little piggie as Edge follows behind. They spend some time rolling around in the mud and enjoying the summer heat. \u0026#34;Look at you, all dirty! Maybe we should visit the beach to rinse off,\u0026#34; suggests Edge.\nThe two begin their hike past the Elderine guard spearmen, guard archers and through Forest of Mist, before reaching Sand Beach. They splash in the water, cleaning off and collecting starfish and clams. As they admire the push and pull of the ocean, they hear footsteps approaching. _Egg\u0026#39;s husband, _Toast, walks toward them with colourful heart-shaped balloons in hand.\n\u0026#34;Happy Birthday, my love! You\u0026#39;re so far from home it took me a while to find you,\u0026#34; exclaims _Toast, \u0026#34;Why don\u0026#39;t we head back and sit by the stadium to watch the sunset?\u0026#34; \u0026#34;I can make a picnic for us!\u0026#34; Suggests Edge excitedly.\nThe three make their way back to Elderine, stopping by a bed of flowers to admire their beauty. _Egg rarely finds her way outside the Elderine walls. She looks at her husband and her friend, soaking in the moment until they reach the front gates.\n\u0026#34;Home sweet home,\u0026#34; sighs _Egg. The trio walk to the stadium stairs and set up their picnic, enjoying the view of the town below them. They share stories and snacks as the sun sets, recounting their love for the town and its inhabitants. Perhaps tomorrow _Egg will go on another adventure, whether that be within the town walls standing next to people with descriptive names (_Egg enjoys \u0026#34;turning into\u0026#34; an _Egg McMuhffin, HardcoreFarmer _Egg, Sulking _Egg etc.) or outside the gates to face the merciless mobs, _Egg knows that her companions are good eggs and they\u0026#39;ll keep her safe.\n","description":"Yaya's Friend _Egg goes on a little adventure and gets a nice present","id":37,"section":"adventures","tags":["story","adventure","friend","_egg"],"title":"The Ultimate Yolk","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/friends/the-ultimate-yolk/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep,\nI have a couple new sections to announce! Well, its really a section and a sub-section. The first is a full section completely dedicated to reviews! The other is a sub-section of my adventures section that is dedicated to other adventures, or adventures that are of a more original nature!\nThe new section Reviews is best seeing as a logical extension of my guides section, but it is also broad enough to warrant its own section, in my opinion. It will be a collection of reviews, primarily of games that I\u0026#39;ve played, that I hope will help you decide if you would like to play them. The reviews will have different headings with relating to the strengths and weaknesses of that game and, guess what? The first review is already up!\nNow I\u0026#39;m not saying that my opinion should be bible or that it is even perfect, but its mine and I hope it will be one voice that will help you decide if you want to give your time and/or money to play the game. Keep in mind that I am a story-driven player. I play games mostly for the story, so this will be a strong draw for me in deciding if a game is worth my time. That said, graphics and gameplay are also important and will be considered.\nThe new sub-section You already get to see some of my art, and now you might just be able to read more of my original stories. The new sub-section, other adventures will collect some of these stories for you to read. Please read them if you want. I\u0026#39;m just putting them out there. I\u0026#39;m not saying I\u0026#39;m a good writer or anything, but maybe, just maybe I\u0026#39;ll be a good storyteller at least.\nThe forums! Going along with this release, I plan on adding threads to the my forums for my original adventures so you can comment on them if you\u0026#39;d like. I will also be adding a new forum for the reviews section and adding threads for my reviews. You can, of course, still comment on these using the comment box, but I\u0026#39;m hoping the forum threads can be used for my in-depth discussions.\n","description":"Say hello to the other adventures and reviews sections!","id":38,"section":"news","tags":["site","forum","news"],"title":"A new section and a new sub-section","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/a-new-section-and-a-new-sub-section/"},{"content":" \u0026nbsp; Stray, what can I say about Stray? Stray starts with you immediately taking control of an adorable little tabby cat as he explorers the world with his liter-mates. This serves as an excellent why for you to learn the game, as well as a prologue for the story. The story quickly turns and things get very interesting very quick. The story was definitely not what I was expecting.\nOverall Overall the game is not bad. Controls are fairly easy if not a big finicky sometimes the graphics are nice and you can tell there was a lot of attention-to-detail where comes to the cat and its movements and mannerisms. The story is also very interesting even if it is a bit unexpected. The game, however, is also very short. I completed the game in less than 10 hours.\nLength As I mentioned, I completed the game in under 10 hours and there is even an achievement available to complete the game in less than two hours. For certain games, this length is not bad, but this is not a fast-twitch shooter and is very story-driven so the length is a problem. It feels like there isn\u0026#39;t enough content to warrant a full price. This might not be as much of a factor if you don\u0026#39;t pay full price, however.\nGraphics This is where I admit that I played this game on my Steam Deck. The Steam Deck to a fair job with the game and it looked very good, but the hardware did limit how detailed and sharp the graphics were. I believe this is more of a problem with the hardware and not with the game. The game has great potential and I\u0026#39;m sure the cat looks very nice and fluffy on better hardware. The art direction and style is great and the cities look crowded and lived in and yet abandoned all at the same time.\nStory The story is great! Again, if the game wasn\u0026#39;t so short it would be awesome and that is mostly because of the story. Maybe it would have been better as a movie, but I\u0026#39;m not sure how it could have been done. The medium does actually suit this style of storytelling. If only it was a bit longer. There is a story though, and it is deeeep. I won\u0026#39;t spoil anything, but, if you\u0026#39;re looking for a cute game where you\u0026#39;re just exploring a city as a cat, well you might be disappointed, but, if you keep your mind open you might enjoy the game for its awesome story telling and emotions. By the end of the story I really felt for my poor kitty. Don\u0026#39;t worry though, there is a good ending!\n","description":"Stray is a very cute game where you play as a cat!","id":39,"section":"reviews","tags":["review","game","cat","cute"],"title":"Stray [2.5/5]","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/reviews/stray/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep!\nHow is your summer? Is it hot enough for chu all yet? It is certainly hot enough for me, or at least it has been. Now, if your from like Arizona or Texas you might be thinking, why is this girl complaining about 94 degree weather, to which I say‚Ä¶That‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶still‚Ä¶hot üòù Just you tend to get hotter and so it doesn\u0026#39;t seem as bad. Anyway, this is just a quick update for you all. I\u0026#39;ve made a few changes to parts of the site and have some plans I want to outline, mostly for myself. Let\u0026#39;s get started!\nWhat changed!? Honestly, not much, but the original version of this site was written a few years ago when I was‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶too invested in a certain MMORPG. While I still play it, its not nearly as much a part of my life as it was when I first wrote many of the pages of this site, including the introduction. So I changed them. Mostly just made minor adjustments, but the introduction page no longer shows my characters or there levels from Fiesta. If you want to find me in that game just start by locating Yayoi_chi or hit me up in the socials linked at the bottom of each page! Other than that I have made effort to highlight some of the other games I play and not solely call out Fiesta.\nSo about that new stuff‚Ä¶ With the focus now more on all the games I\u0026#39;m playing, or have played, I am planning to flesh out the guides and may even and a place for reviews and/or stories from the games I am playing, but that isn\u0026#39;t the big news! I am also thinking, just thinking, about adding a section for short stories. You already get to see some of my drawings, but drawing is not my only creative outlet. Now, writing fiction usually takes me a long time and it is harder for me to release my writing than to show off my drawings, so you\u0026#39;ll have to be patient, and I might not even release this section, but I will keep you up to date. I plan on updating the site once a week now!\n","description":"Just a few notes on directions for the site and recent changes","id":40,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"A few site notes","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/a-few-stie-notes/"},{"content":" Over the past year I have been working as a behavior technician. This has been a fun and rewarding opportunity for me, but it has also be very taxing. I have worked long days and then I worked normal days but was also taking classes full time while working on a PhD. This left me with very little time for anything fun. Well, learning was fun, but not the right kind of fun. I was feeling burnt out and the stresses of managing my cases, dealing with things like tantrums, and all the hours worked were starting to get to me in an unhealthy way. Last month I made the decision to leave.\nToo many spinning plates It was certainly not easy to decide to leave my job. I did like the kiddos I was working with, well most of them, and the work was enjoyable, for the most part. I probably would have kept going too if it wasn\u0026#39;t for my grades last term. Reviewing all of my assignments I knew I wasn\u0026#39;t going to get the kinds of grades I wanted. I could spot everything I was doing wrong, but, whether it was lack of focus after an assignment or during the readings, I just couldn\u0026#39;t find a way to fix the mistakes I knew I was making. I had said that, if I went back to school, then that would take priority and nothing should harm that.\nIn fact, I came up with this little analogy. It was like I had two plates spinning on toothpicks. Both started out spinning just fine, but than they started to wobble and I couldn\u0026#39;t fix them without dropping at least one. I could try my hardest to get them both going again, but, at the end of the day, I needed to let one go so the other could spin right. I chose my work. It has fallen, but now I can have the time and energy to get the school plate spinning up right again!\nHobbies and mental health In truth there were probably more than the two plates. Perhaps one for this site, one for my other art and web projects, and maybe even one for video games. Hobbies, and other things that distract us from the grind of work, are required, I think, in maintaining our mental health. We can\u0026#39;t be all about work and school, or work and family, or even work, family, and school. We need to balance those things with \u0026#34;me\u0026#34; time. Time to just do what you really like to do with or without other people involved. This is where our hobbies come in. They provide unstructured time for us to just be us. I think I lost track of that over the last year, and that may be one reason things didn\u0026#39;t go so well at either work or school.\nMaybe not more time, but more quality time In the summary I said, we can\u0026#39;t make more time. This comes from an interaction between a parent and their child (my client). The child does not speak, but is learning sign language. They often make the sign for more followed by the sign for time. This is interpreted as a request for more time with something, a toy or activity. However, sometimes they would make these signs with no context and the parent would be left wondering what the child was requesting. This was a simple lexical error, but it led to the following interaction:\nchild signs more and time\nparent: More time? More time with what?\nchild repeats signs\nparent: More time? I can\u0026#39;t make more time! Time is a finite thing.\nIts true, time is a finite resource, we\u0026#39;re only given so much of it and we can\u0026#39;t just make more. What we can do though is make better use of the time we have. In other words, we can make more quality time or make our time better. This is what I intend to do now!\nLesson learned! So now I will be a bit picky with how I\u0026#39;m spending my time, I will be balancing it better not just between work (if I find another job) and school, but also between hobbies, family, and entertainment. All of these are important! Any future place of employment that would like me to work weekends or evenings will have to understand that is not something I will be doing, I won\u0026#39;t mind if it was something I occasionally had to do, but I will decide when and how often that is, it will not be decided for me. I am done with that part of my life now.\nAs for what the means for this site! Well, I\u0026#39;m hoping I\u0026#39;ll update it more often and add different guides and maybe new art more frequently. I hope you\u0026#39;ll look forward to that!\n","description":"You can't make more time, you can only make the most of the time you have!","id":41,"section":"news","tags":["news","personal","site"],"title":"More time!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/more-time/"},{"content":" I\u0026#39;m hoping this isn\u0026#39;t going to be a very long entry, but we won\u0026#39;t know that until I have written the whole thing üòù. I\u0026#39;m not in a very serious mood, though maybe I should be. On Saturday, 13 May, I was very tired and stayed in bed most of the time. I let my parents know and I was visited with a COVID-19 test. I took the test and I tested positive for COVID in 2023!\nAbout my COVID Case I\u0026#39;ll get this out of the way really quick. If anyone reading this is worried, you don\u0026#39;t have to be. My case is very mild and I have been recovering rather quickly. I am keeping myself isolated and all is well so far. I will be unable to work for the next four days, but this is a procedure from the company due to the nature of my job.\nThe Good Part Believe it or not, this isn\u0026#39;t all bad. I\u0026#39;ve been feeling overworked and burnt out lately. I never have time for self-care and hobbies. This includes updating this website. I have time for this now and I have been playing games and drawing.\nIn fact, I\u0026#39;m hoping to add another picture to my Creations very soon. This one is taking a little long because I was not able to be up very long during the weekend, but I should have time to work on it a bit more soon, though I am working through some needed training and still doing school work as I don\u0026#39;t need to leave for that.\nFor the future Yesterday I started Portal again, I noticed something I haven\u0026#39;t noticed before. Portal is my favorite game and I\u0026#39;m still learning new things. I haven\u0026#39;t decided to, but I might add some Portal achievement guides or walkthroughs. Again, I\u0026#39;m not sure I will want to do this, but at least I warned you if I do decide to. I may also look into other walkthroughs and guides to add while I\u0026#39;m out. I know this isn\u0026#39;t much of a plan yet, but I just wanted to through this in here.\n","description":"COVID-19 is still here and I found out the hard way!","id":42,"section":"news","tags":["news","personal"],"title":"Covid Visit!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/covid-visit/"},{"content":" After pushing some updates to my Fiesta Guides a little early, I am back with a few small changes that I was not able to quite get done before having to push those updates! The big thing is I had to change my age in my introduction. Yep, it went up by one because yesterday was my birthday!\nBirthday Stuff! I\u0026#39;ll get this out of the way real quick because there are other things I still need to get in this post. I had a great birthday yesterday. I went out for some Italian food with family and otherwise enjoyed the day. I didn\u0026#39;t get much time to play, which is what I would\u0026#39;ve liked to do on my birthday, but I did have plenty of fun. At 39, birthdays mean something totally different than they did at 10 or 12. I may not have got any presents or had a ton of friends over, but I had a good time. That\u0026#39;s all that really matters. Speaking of friends, well, I don\u0026#39;t really have many. Let\u0026#39;s see if we can change that üòâ\nNew addition to the bottom matter of the site! Since I originally deployed this version of the site I was aware I could put icons and links to my social media profiles on the bottom of the site near the footer in the template that I am using. Other than potentially putting my steam profile down there though, I didn\u0026#39;t really see much point in them, so I just put my e-mail in and that was that. Well I changed it!\nRecently, I joined Matrix and I had switched from Twitter to Mastodon a while ago, both of these sites are supported by the template so I figured, why not just put those in there, and why not have my Steam profile in too. So I added those! I am on Matrix most, but any of these options are good if you want to connect with me. We can talk about the site, MMO\u0026#39;s and JRPGS, or whatever. I would like to know people actually read these üòÜ\nFinally updated my introduction The introduction page was out of date in more than one way. Not only was my age out of date, but all the levels of my Fiesta characters also needed updating. I\u0026#39;ve since fixed that. There have also been small updates throughout the site including adding a link in the footer to my forums. Hey! That\u0026#39;s one other way you can reach me!\nLooking forward As I mentioned, I am busy pursuing a PhD and working. I\u0026#39;m hoping that the next year will not only see some progress on this front but also progress with gaming and the site. Also I\u0026#39;d like to draw more. So let\u0026#39;s hope it all comes together in the next year!\n","description":"I had a birthday!","id":43,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Birthday!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/birthday/"},{"content":" First I did want to kind of get this out of the way! I\u0026#39;ve been playing a lot of games on my Steam Deck and I love it. Its a great thing to have when waiting in my car between appointments and shtuff! So far this has only really served to get in the way of finishing both my Made in Abyss and Persona 4 Golden guides because I have been basically hoping all over the place, including some older games üòâ Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll at least get back to Made in Abyss soon. As for what\u0026#39;s actually new, well‚Ä¶ not much.\nYaya, where the heck are the updates? Well, the short of it is I\u0026#39;m busy and bad at time management üòÖ I\u0026#39;ve been doing a little better and I\u0026#39;ve cut some hours at work, actually been having a lot of cancellations, which is actually why I\u0026#39;m writing this now. Aside from that I\u0026#39;ve been scheduling things and tracking time better. Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll be able to squeeze more time in to maintaining this site and maybe finish playing something so I can finish a guide other than my Fiesta guide.\nSo, I heard there\u0026#39;s a new gallery! There is! I\u0026#39;ve been doing these season-based wallpapers ever since I ran the Dracula theme on all of my devices last autumn. I decided I\u0026#39;d gather those and share them on my website. Now I\u0026#39;ve tried to attribute where I could, but I don\u0026#39;t remember where I got these wallpapers, and I did not make them. My e-mail is linked on all pages and you can also write a comment on the page and let me know if you\u0026#39;d rather me not link these images or if you know who to attribute them too. Please understand I did not steal these and do not claim they are mine. If you ask for them to be removed please provide proof of ownership and give me time to remove them. Otherwise enjoy the images!\nHow about so more art? Speaking of images, I am very aware that my Creations Gallery is looking pretty sparse. Amongst the various things I have not had time to do, drawing is just one of them. I\u0026#39;m hoping, with some of the extra time I have this week, that I will be able to add at least one more item to that gallery soon. Problem is‚Ä¶ I have no idea what to draw. I literally have no ideas, but maybe inspiration will spark soon. I\u0026#39;d really like to have some new shtuff to show you!\nAny way, not really a good update, but I hope its good enough. I also hope I will have better updates soon!\n","description":"I added a wallpaper gallery!","id":44,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"New Gallery!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/new-gallery/"},{"content":"This is a collection of some of my favorite wallpapers.

You see I was working on playing Persona 4 Golden and completing guides for that game kept me updating the site fairly regularly. Unfortunately, my focused unexpectedly shifted to another game. I hadn\u0026#39;t originally wanted to do a guide on this game, but I found that it was taking a lot of my time and some of that is because I am ending up having to restart section and back track a lot. The game I\u0026#39;m referring too is Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness and it is definitely not easy. I like it, but it offers quite a challenge. After getting lost a few times and, as I mentioned, a lot of back tracking and reloading, I decided to start a guide and some maps for the game to make things a little easier. This has led to this new update for the site! I don\u0026#39;t really have anything else to report on, but thought I small update was better than none üòÖ\n","description":"Another new guide","id":46,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","mia"],"title":"Hard Game is HARD!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/hard-game-is-hard/"},{"content":" The first layer starts at the Netherworld Gate is fairly small and pretty easy to traverse!

My name is Yayoi and I am a moon whistle who has learned a thing or two about cave raiding. I\u0026#39;m writing down some of the things I\u0026#39;ve learned in hopes that it may help you out (and me üòú) out on your next cave raid! We\u0026#39;ll go over a few general tips here, nothing too specific, because, well, you know everything is limited. Speaking of limited, that this first thing I think you should remember about cave raiding.\nKnow your limits! As a cave raider who have to be mindful of your limits. How long can you run? How far can you climb? (stamina) How long can you survive without food or water (fullness)? How much pain can you endure (HP)? How much can you carry (g)? These are all very important things to keep in mind. As you get used to cave raiding you\u0026#39;re limits will increase, but you have to always be aware of this, because, if you forget you could easily find yourself in a very irredeemable situation.\nKnow your purpose! Because every resource is limited each cave raid should have a purpose, a reason you going down that day. That reason could be just to explore, it could be to complete a specific request, or it could be to get new experience, hunt relics, or gather resources. A specific purpose, however, helps you to limit how far you\u0026#39;ll go and what exactly you should bring with you.\nExploration If you are diving solely to explore The Abyss you have to be the most careful. You don\u0026#39;t want to starve before you can go very far nor do you want to be killed because you found a new creature you don\u0026#39;t have the means to fight. If you decide go down for exploration focus on bringing weapons, ammo, and food. You may want to focus on bringing ingredients for cooking rather than buying and carrying cooked dishes. However, you may need to bring a few big dishes with you depending on how far your initial dive will be.\nBringing ingredients with you as well as plenty of weapons and ammo means you can hunt while you explore. Cooked dishes are heavy, but ingredients for dishes are relatively light (except meat), meaning you can carry more ingredients, but don\u0026#39;t take every ingredient you can buy or carry. Focus on dishes you know you can get some of the ingredients for as you explore. For example, if you are in second layer, you know you can get plenty of eggs and bird meat as well as a lot of various herbs, so focus on bringing things like salt or spices that you can use with these ingredients to cook bird meat and eggs. There are only a few dishes that you can cook just by gathering ingredients in The Abyss, so keep this in mind when exploring.\nFinally, while exploring, only attack things you can cook and avoid attacking or being attacked as much as possible. You\u0026#39;ll bring a lot of weapons and ammo, but you\u0026#39;ll want to save these for things that you can kill to help you survive and not for defense if possible. Also don\u0026#39;t go to far at once. This goes back to knowing your limits. Know how far you can go with the supplies you have and only go about half that far so you have enough supplies to get back to the surface.\nRequests This is similar to exploration in that you will want to focus on weapons and ammo. Depending on how far you have to go to complete a request you may decide to bring less food or focus on pre-cooked dishes rather than ingredients. My one piece of advice for you though, is don\u0026#39;t take on too many requests at once! Focus on one request at a time unless you have requests that are both short and not far from each other.\nIf you come across a request while you are exploring this is where you have to make a potentially difficult decision. Take a look at your current supplies, decide how far you could go, then decide if you should return to the surface before completing the request or try to complete it with the resources you currently have. Some short requests can easily be done while your exploring, but don\u0026#39;t forget your initial purpose and don\u0026#39;t be mindful of what you can do with the supplies you currently have.\nRelic Hunting and Gathering If this is the reason you want to cave raid today, than you\u0026#39;ll want to keep as much room available for gathering or carrying relics as you can. Some advice, however, decide where you want to relic hunt or gather resources and take only the weapons and food that you\u0026#39;ll need to get to that location plus at least one extra weapon to defend yourself if you need to. If you are relic hunting, remember that cooked food is heavy and so are relics, so make sure you balance this well and focus on ingredients. Most things you\u0026#39;ll be gathering are fairly light so you can bring some cooked food with you if you want. If you want to do both at the same time then start by gathering, as these are lighter, and then move on to relic hunting as you use resources and weapons.\nKnow Where Your Going and Where You\u0026#39;ve Been Take this from a cave raider who has gotten lost more than her fair share of times, you\u0026#39;ll always want to know where you are, where you\u0026#39;re going, and where you\u0026#39;ve been. You\u0026#39;ll want to know these things for two reasons, to help you know how far you\u0026#39;ve gone and to know how to get back to the surface once you need to. No one wants to starve because they got lost!\nIts for this reason that I have begun putting together some maps to help you (and me) navigate The Abyss. So far I have mapped out all the various section of the first layer and how to traverse to and from each area. You can use these maps to help you navigate to specific areas and back in the first layer so you don\u0026#39;t get lost, like I have.\nAnother thing to remember is that it is far easier to descend in the abyss than it is to ascend. To put it another way going down is easier than going up. This is not just because climbing is harder than jumping down, but also due to the curse! If you go up too fast you\u0026#39;ll feel its effects and you\u0026#39;ll need to rest and get used to the new depth. I advise that you always take the time to do this when ascending because you don\u0026#39;t want to be blinded by the curse while creatures are near you or lose your lunch!\n","description":"Cave raiding is not an easy profession and there are certainly a few things you'll need to consider when making a dive.

Christmas has come and gone, along with all the winter-y shenanigans that game with it for Fiesta. I got a new lap desk for my computer setup, I went back to school after my winter break and‚Ä¶well some other life shtuff that we don\u0026#39;t need to talk about here ( \u0026gt; . \u0026gt; )\nNew Game! One good thing that happened this last month was the release of a remake of Persona 3 Portable on steam. I had started playing Persona 3 on PlayStation 2 a long time ago, I was really impressed with it, but never got to finish it. I\u0026#39;m looking forward to finishing it now. I will be writing guides for it has a play, just like I\u0026#39;m doing with Persona 4 Golden. Right now there is just an index up, since I\u0026#39;m still playing Persona 4, but I\u0026#39;ll get things going as soon as a start Persona 3.\nReturning to Eorzea One of my Christmas presents from a good friend, was the complete collection for Final Fantasy XIV. I really enjoyed playing this game when I first got the base game. It has a really good story, but I got stopped playing, even though I wasn\u0026#39;t finished with Havensward, when I hit max level because I didn\u0026#39;t want to get too far behind. Now that I have the expansions I\u0026#39;ve started playing again.\nFFXIV Guides? When? All that said I have a confession to make. Originally I wanted this site to focus on guides for MMOs because those could be a bit hard to find. So I started my fiesta guides. I was playing FFXIV for the first time as I wrote these and my plan was to write guides for that game next. Here\u0026#39;s the problem, I\u0026#39;m not sure what I can contribute here. There are plenty of guides already available online for FFXIV as it is a very popular game. For the time being, I won\u0026#39;t be writing guides for FFXIV. This could change in the future, if I can find a way to contribute. in the meantime, enjoy my other guides!\n","description":"I'm still building new guides and making the website bigger","id":49,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","persona","ffxiv"],"title":"Ready for a New Game!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/ready-for-a-new-game/"},{"content":" First thing is first! Marry Christmas everyone! This week, Christmas came to Fiesta. Like the Halloween update, this is kind of a major thing that happens every year. I don\u0026#39;t look forward to it quite as much, but it is nice seeing everything in a more winter-like wonderland. There are some new events and stuff and I\u0026#39;ll see about adding them to my event guide, but, for now I have more news to share!\nBuggy Bug! First I need to make a quick announcement! Everyone, please update your bookmarks! The URL of this site may have changed slightly. Please use the https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/ URL for the main site. For some reason the old URL breaks the root navigation link in the navigation bar. This doesn\u0026#39;t appear to affect the Japanese version, but does effect the English version if your using an older URL that has \u0026#34;en/\u0026#34; in it.\nA guide not for Fiesta appears! Lately I\u0026#39;ve been playing some games that aren\u0026#39;t Fiesta. I know, shocking, isn\u0026#39;t it üòù. I mean I did say there were other games that I play and I did get something new to play games on (I\u0026#39;ll talk more about that in a bit), so why not play through some of my Steam backlog? While playing through that I started playing a certain JRPG that I just recently got on Steam after only having it for PS2 before.\nThe fun thing about JRPGs is they, like many RPGs actually, are very complicated and it can be challenging to get through everything without a guide. I like this challenge, but I like writing down things I discover along the way too. So I created a guide for Persona 4 Golden.\nI have split the guides up into sections, but, at the moment, many of these are just placeholders waiting for me to fill them up. You\u0026#39;ll have to bare with me a bit while I go about completing the story, writing my walkthrough, and working on the other sections. Normally I try to avoid the \u0026#34;under construction\u0026#34; signs and stuff that plagued sites in the 90\u0026#39;s, but this time I want you to see how the guides evolve so its not \u0026#34;under construction\u0026#34; its a \u0026#34;work in progress\u0026#34; üòÜ\nSteamy Deck is steamy I had a friend wanting to see my gaming setup, but, you know what, it really wasn\u0026#39;t much to look at. I don\u0026#39;t really like flashy RGB and I don\u0026#39;t have like a nice keyboard or even a monitor. Instead I had a very simple box connected to a TV. In fact, I was a console gamer pretending to be a part of the PC master race, really. You know what though, valve made a machine for people like me.\nYep its the Steam Deck! That\u0026#39;s it right there sitting on top of a PS4 slim üòÜ. It is still connected to a TV, not pictured, but it also rests on a shelf above the box that used to serve as my gaming PC looong ago. Still helps me run some old Windows games, like Fiesta üòâ, but its mostly just a media and file server now.\nI like the Steam Deck so far, but I\u0026#39;ve only played it a little bit. It is very portable and a big lighter feeling than I was expecting when I first pulled it out. It is much larger than my Switch though. Oh, I have played it handheld a few times and it is really nice. The thing is like if a PC was thrown into a room with a Switch and they had a baby, especially with the dock. It is a Bring You Own Controller affair, but it is nice. Also, as you can tell, I\u0026#39;m not wanting for controllers at the moment. Actually, the two in the peekture are just two in a set of three PS4 controllers I have, and the JoyCon, Nintendo Switch Pro Wired Controller, XBox One Controller, Steam Controller, and SF30 Pro aren\u0026#39;t even shown. Yeah, I have a lot üòÖ\n","description":"I'm building new guides and making the website bigger","id":50,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","fiesta"],"title":"Make my website grow!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023/make-my-website-grow/"},{"content":"I draw too!

Currently I\u0026#39;m hoping to keep this to one page and just have a few helpful tricks and hints to completing the events. This will be far from a complete guide to everything about the event, but should be enough for you to have looots of good fun!\nMaze of Madness First up is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness! The Maze of Madness comes about around Halloween time each year. Halloween is celebrated in the US on the 31 of October every year and is all about spooky things! It also happens to be one of my favorite holidays because there is nothing quite as fun as spooky shenanigans. Fortunately the maze is pretty spooky, though kind of more in a juvenile since, but I degrees.\nDuring this event, your goal is to pick up little Halloween tickets. These tickets can be used to purchase all sorts of goodies including permanent outfits! Of course, the maze itself is only one way to earn these tickets, but you can get up to three each time you complete the maze. One ticket for completing it and then two for helping to beat the boss that you can get to by talking to an NPC at the maze\u0026#39;s center.\nPictured are the various routes you can take to reach the center of the maze. To get to the Maze you must travel through a portal by the fountain in Elderine (Sir Gourd van Pumpkin also stands near this portal, you can exchange your tickets with him for items!). This will take you to the Maze of Madness world where you will then have to head for another portal directly in front of where you spawn to enter the maze proper. You will spawn in one of three locations, these are numbered on the map. Also pictured are the spawn locations as they appear in the in-game map.\nOther Quests Before heading into the maze, however, it\u0026#39;s a good idea to look around at the small town-like area you spawn into. There are two NPCs here. These NPCs have quests and each quest can help you get even more tickets. Some of these quests are repeatable and some are daily. Unlike most quests the Fiesta Wiki does not list these quests, but they are usually pretty straightforward. Most of them just require you to gather items from either tombstones or pumpkins from patches outside the maze and return them to the NPCs. There is one, however, that I would like to single out.\nPop goes the Pumpkin This is a daily quest that you can acquire from JackO Pumpkin Jr., the NPC nearest the maze sign. This requires you to beat the maze and the boss you can fight after speaking to the NPC at its center, Pumpkin Bill. I single it out both because it is different and because it awards 10 tickets per day! To beat the boss, gather from pumpkins in the area around Bill. These pumpkins allow drop grenades and warheads. Equip these to your skill bar for ease. You cannot damage Bill with your regular attacks and your skills are locked in this world, so you must throw these items at the boss until he falls. It takes about 100 grenades to take him down, if you\u0026#39;re lucky, however, you won\u0026#39;t be alone. Return to the NPC after you kill him to get a body back in your inventory, open this for some goodies and your 10 tickets!\nOther Things to Note There are titles for completing the maze under a certain time or certain conditions. One condition I remember was running it in under two minutes as a pinky (the candies you acquire from body bags and other rewards will randomly transform you into mobs) and completing the maze in under two minutes normally. I\u0026#39;ll update this section as more things come to mind!\nTerry! (Easter egg event) This is a list of where Terry can appear.

I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!\nMaze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta. There are also events! Now, you can read the full list on gamigo\u0026#39;s news page, but my favorite is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness. This is where you have to navigate your way through a maze while avoiding a certain monster, if they hit you, your out and you have to start the maze all over again. As I said, it can be very frustrating, but it can also be very fun! Last year I loved to run through the maze with friends. Unfortunately they\u0026#39;ve mostly moved on to other games, but a few still run around with me, and that\u0026#39;s great.\nA new guide? The maze can be a bit tricky to navigate, but a friend made a good graphic to help so I\u0026#39;ve put together a guide that shows how to get through the maze as well as a few other tips and tricks. Of course I don\u0026#39;t remember everything from last year, and I believe my characters all got the titles already, but I\u0026#39;ll do my best. When I get the guide made I\u0026#39;ll link it here for you.\nGlad I\u0026#39;m wrong! In this guess I\u0026#39;m really happy I was wrong. I was very worried that I wouldn\u0026#39;t get Halloween content this year, but I did and that\u0026#39;s awesome! There is still one problem‚Ä¶.the problem of time. Since I began working I have, naturally, less time for playing games. I managed to squeeze in a little this week, but I\u0026#39;m not sure it will be enough for all the rewards. I suppose I can only hope that I\u0026#39;ll have just as much fun this year as I did last!\n","description":"So, I was wrong üòÖ","id":53,"section":"news","tags":["fiesta","news"],"title":"The halloween towns are here!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022/the-halloween-towns-are-here/"},{"content":" Hi hi everypeep üëãüèª\nIs everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and‚Ä¶.the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October. However, it is now almost Halloween proper, just 11 days of the day I\u0026#39;m writing this, and still no sign of my spook-tacular towns ü•≤\nNo news is good news? So, naturally, someone might think, well golly Yayoi you just gotta be patient, after all they haven\u0026#39;t said their not doing Halloween shinanigins, right? I mean sure, that\u0026#39;s true, but it isn\u0026#39;t like they haven\u0026#39;t mentioned Halloween at all. Earlier this week the Fiesta Online team posted this article on their site\u0026#39;s official news section. The mention Jack-O Pumpkin, who has been a staple of events surrounding the Halloween update, but what is the actual news? The scarier-than-every Halloween sale yay! They talk about getting Halloween-themed costumes, masks, tails, and other stuff for 30% off in the item store, but no mention of anything else related to Jack-O\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;favorite time of year\u0026#34; I know, they still haven\u0026#39;t mentioned that they aren\u0026#39;t doing anything, but this seems like they would rather just throw up a sale, maybe make some extra money and have the whole holiday done and dusted!\nWhat has happened to Halloween? This is really my favorite time of year, always has been. I love any excuse to celebrate things scary, creepy, and even a bit gory (just don\u0026#39;t tell my friends üòâ), yet it seems everyone is just skipping over Halloween. I mean, I guess I get it, from a marking standpoint, Halloween, Thanksgiving (US), and Christmas are all right in line and the last two are very major holidays, and, with both Halloween and Christmas being about giving something out and getting something back, it makes since for companies like Gamigo to pour more energy into Christmas than Halloween. Doesn\u0026#39;t mean I have to like it though üò§\nI could be wrong Maybe, by the time this goes up and/or the time you read it, I\u0026#39;ve been proven wrong and Gamigo did, in fact, release the Halloween content I know and love. I would love for that to be the guess. Please prove me wrong here Gamigo üôèüèª However, I\u0026#39;m not holding my breath just yet.\nPraying for Halloween Content, -Yayoi\n","description":"Every year for the past three at least, Fiesta does a halloween theme every where, but not this year...maybe?","id":54,"section":"news","tags":["fiesta","news"],"title":"Where's the Halloween Towns!?","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022/where-are-the-halloween-towns/"},{"content":"This is my Wall o\u0026rsquo; ADVENTURE!

I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I\u0026#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the \u0026#34;real\u0026#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven\u0026#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I\u0026#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it üòÖ I haven\u0026#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.\nGoogle Translate‚Ä¶NO! So umm, the Introduction has been written in Japanese. Other section home pages are not translated and really just say that, but the introduction page is translated. Here\u0026#39;s the problem. I failed to find some words in my old Japanese vocabulary and don\u0026#39;t have my old English to Japanese dictionary. Google Translate to the rescue, right!? Well kind of. Where has Google Translate can be a good English to Japanese, Japanese to English, or Any Language to Any Other Language dictionary, it isn\u0026#39;t so good at translating full sentences accurately, this is really more art the science. Sure, I\u0026#39;m 98% sure whatever its outputting can be understood by Japanese speakers, I\u0026#39;m not sure it maintains my tone and stuff. I\u0026#39;m also not sure if what it outputs is something Japanese speakers would really expect to hear, kinda hard to explain, but machine translation can sound too technical and or robotic and nothing like human speech even if it is technically correct.\nOf course, I know all this so I don\u0026#39;t use Google Translate like that, right? Well not exactly. Its easy to just throw a sentence in there see that the output makes since at least and then call it good enough. I try to avoid that, mostly by breaking down what I\u0026#39;m trying to say into something close to what I know how to say, but it happens. So I\u0026#39;m calling on anyone who knows both Japanese and English to help me!\nYou can help! At the bottom of each page is a comment box. I would really like these to be for general comments, but, in the case of the Japanese versions of each page I\u0026#39;d also like these to be used to help me with my Japanese and, more specifically, the translation of that page. You see, those comment boxes generate a GitHub issue I can look at, tag, and then implement, so, if you happen to have a GitHub account (or don\u0026#39;t mind making one üòâ) and know both Japanese and English near fluently than fill free to suggest corrections to the Japanese pages using the comment boxes. Please to provide detailed explanations as to why your version make more since so I can learn. You can, of course, start with the introduction page. Just go there, click the language icon at the bottom-left, switch to Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û), and comment, that easy!\nThanks!\n-Yayoi\n","description":"Since I'm learning Japanese, I've decided to put it into practice, by translating this site!","id":56,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","help"],"title":"Japanese Translation","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022/japanese-translation/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep!\nIf any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven\u0026#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform. First, I guess I little background information is in order.\nYaya\u0026#39;s World and how it was built before If you have visited the site and had a look at your address bar you may have noticed that page was a static HTML page. Every page had the same navigation bar, the same top bar, and the same header. Some might think this was done using Dreamweaver, and it was, at first. Recently though every page was actually written in a simple markup language, then it was built into HTML with all the standard stuff added in by a my editor of choice and that the result was then uploaded to a server. This allowed me to write and edit everything in a pretty distraction free way but still have navigation and everything working on each page on the site. Unfortunately, it became a bit of a chore to build the site and maintain all those template parts (the header and footer). So I just kinda stopped doing it ( ^ ~ ^ ;;\nHow I am trying to build the site now I recently came across an interesting YouTube video by someone named Chris Titus. He was showing off how he managed to keep is site up-to-date and do all the other things he does on a daily basis. I found this kinda of interesting and an answer to my problem of keeping my own site up-to-date. Now I am using Hugo with a theme he recommends to work on my site.\nWhat is Hugo? I don\u0026#39;t know if Hugo makes building websites fun again per se, but it certain makes things easier. Simply put Hugo is a framework for building websites. Its a program that I have installed on my MacBook that takes my ramblings written in Markdown or a similar markup language and builds HTML webpages with from them using a theme that provides some of the things my old site has. This can then be deployed to a my webserver, but this is almost exactly how things worked before only there is less gobbly goop that I have to maintain myself. However, Hugo does a bit more than just build the website.\nHow does Hugo help me? Aside from managing a theme and template for me where I use simple configurations to add and remove things that then apply to all pages and building a static site, Hugo provides a little webserver that allows me to see changes in realtime as I edit them. So I just type in my editor using a simple markup language than save those changes and then go to a browser that is already open to my local webserver and those changes are already applied, no need to hit refresh. This happens whether I\u0026#39;m changing a webpage, editing a theme configuration, or adding something new. I can literally see how it will look on the site before I deploy to the site all without having to hit refresh or anything but just looking at a browser window. Its really helpful. Also I was able to set up a little script I can run that will build and deploy the site with one command, so that\u0026#39;s also cool.\nA regression Everything isn\u0026#39;t quite peachy though. Many of the image-heavy pages, like the ADVENTURES gallery are not up anymore. This is a limitation of how I have Hugo set up currently. I\u0026#39;ll be looking into fixing this has I move forward, however, so hopefully all those memories will be back soon.\nPlans for the future So now I\u0026#39;m hoping to use this platform to expand the site beyond Fiesta Online. I\u0026#39;ve played many other games and, though I still spend most of my time playing MMOs in Fiesta Online, I would like to expand this site to include some of the other things that I end up playing, even things that might not be MMOs ( ^ . ~ ). I hope anyone who might be reading this will stick around and see how this site evolves in the coming months!\n-Yayoi\n","description":"This site is being moved to a new platform in hopes that I won't forget about updating it anymore ( ^ ~ ^ ;;","id":57,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"A New Platform a New Look!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022/a-new-platform-a-new-look/"},{"content":" While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn\u0026#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on.

As I said above, there are no KQs for passed 135 that offer any significant amount of exp, however, many of the hidden dailies and other daily quests you got when you got to 132 are still viable passed 135 and offer some exp. A member of one a guild I am in has broken down the amount of exp, in percentage, that you receive for various levels passed 135. Please note: this is the percentage if you complete all available dailies quests, not the percentage per quest!\n135 - 16.70% 136 - 13.22% 137 - 11.02% 138 - 9.07% 139 - 4.60% New Reps!

Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones. For your reference:\nTier 1 refers to level 1~20 items Tier 2 refers to level 20~50 Tier 3 to 51~80 Tier 4 to 81-99 Tier 5 to 100+ Tier 6 is rserved for lgendary weapons. Enhacement Breakage When enhancing and item, there is a possibility it will break. However, some items seem to have a kind of safe zone in which they won\u0026#39;t break until a certain point. There is still a chance of downgrading, but that doesn\u0026#39;t cause you to lose the item like breaking. Here are the safe zones:\nGenerally best to follow the rule of safe until +3, but here are the more specific safe zones:\nTier 1 never break up to +5 Tier 2 and Tier 3 don\u0026#39;t break until +4 Tier 4 and Tier 5 don\u0026#39;t break until +3 Maximum Enhancement Just how high can you enhance items?

Don\u0026#39;t forget to visit the Fiesta Wiki if you need help following these quest trains or other unlocking steps. It should also be noted that much of this was written before the 140 cap raise and it appears this quests may be available up until 140, I\u0026#39;ll update if I find one that isn\u0026#39;t.\nUrsula\u0026#39;s Mad Garden (lvl 130-140) Enter the Dark Portal (130-140, prequest \u0026#34;Unusual Behavior\u0026#34;, both this and the prequest appear to require a special item) Mysterious Rock (130-140, You need a mysterious rock, which apparently drop in Twilight Void) Precious Ore (131-132, this appears to also require a special item) The Temple Guard (132-133) The Land of the Golden Dragon (132-140) Toxic Monsters (132) Corrupted Adventurers (133 (also known as ghosts), prequests: 130 \u0026#34;To the Ominous Valley\u0026#34;\u0026gt;130 \u0026#34;Ming\u0026#39;s Disaster 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;130 \u0026#34;Ming\u0026#39;s Disaster 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;131 \u0026#34;Ming\u0026#39;s Disaster 4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;133 \u0026#34;Ming\u0026#39;s Disaster 5\u0026#34;, this is best done with a party as these ghosts are hard!)

Each class is best suited to a particular role such as Damange Dealer (DD), Damage over Time (DoT), Area of Effect (AoE), Tank, or Support. I won\u0026#39;t go into details as to which class works best in which role as that is laid out very well on Fiesta\u0026#39;s Main Site. However builds can be tricky since each class has its own strength and weaknesses while its leveling such that what works for Archers my not work for Mages (even though they both specialize in AoE). So, here are the generally accepted builds and what classes to use with them üòâ.\nAll STR This is easy as from the start, you just dump all of your skill points into STR. At first this seems like a really good build for all characters, but a character without DEF dies üòµ. One might be tempted to use this for a tank role, but tanks are supposed to take dmg not give it. Really the only classes where this build works is Crusader, as they have good DEF by default and also have support skills, and Fighter (Gladiator Specifically) that focus more on DD roles than tanking.\nClasses: üó°üõ°üëªüèπ\nFull END Like All STR, full END just has you dump all of your points in one stat, in this case END. This will maximize your health and defenses. This is well suited for support classes, especially clerics, and tanks. People tend do die if the clericor tank dies so the more defense and HP they have the better.\nClasses: üõ°üó°‚úùÔ∏è\nTotally DEX Dumping all your points into DEX may seem odd, but some classes can really utilize this well. Besides who needs DEF if the mobs can\u0026#39;t even hit you ü§™. Keep in mind though, you are sacrificing your potential in other areas. This really only makes since when you can kill fairly quickly too, so only DDs really, and you will still need some DEF. Just be careful with this one.\nClasses: üëªüèπ\nPure SPR I\u0026#39;m listing this just because its a possibility to maximize your character\u0026#39;s SP, M.DEF, and crit rate, but you will need very good gear or you still won\u0026#39;t do much dmg and will probably die a lot too üòÖ.\nClasses: üßôüèπ\n33 DEX/Rest STR The above DD build (All STR) is great, but it ignores aim. Sprinkling in a few points to SPR, until you have 33 (or maximum of 67) fixes this helping your DD hit more often. This build is well suited for all those recommended for the All STR builds.\nClasses: üó°üõ°üëª\n25 SPR/Rest END The above support build (Full END) is also great, but it ignores SP and crit rate. You can sprinkle in a few points into SPR until you have 25 to fix this, I highly recommend this build for Holy Knights since they tend to burn through available SP, also anyone in a support role can use some extra crits when they need to solo üòâ.\nClasses: üõ°üó°‚úùÔ∏è\n25 SPR/33 DEX/Rest STR This build maximize your attack power and crit rate while making it you a hard target to hit. You can use gear to help with DEF and M.DEF.\nClasses: üèπüßôüëª\n50 END/33 DEX/25 SPR/Rest STR If you\u0026#39;re looking for a wellrounded build that is nearly perfect for player-versus-player (PVP), this is the build for you. A reminder though, this is a jack-of-all-trades/master-of-none type situation, and many classesw have gear and armor to help with stats like END.\nClasses: üõ°üèπüßôüëª\n","description":"A basic overview of the types of builds in Fiesta Online","id":63,"section":"guides","tags":["guide"],"title":"Builds","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/builds/"}]
