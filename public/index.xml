        <description>All of my servants told me the Yawning Portal would be the best place to seek adventure. While I was not entirely sheltered by my parents, being my father&amp;#39;s youngest daughter, ensured that I was not treated with the same freedom or independence as my eldest sister or my older brothers, but living under the shadow of my father&amp;#39;s station, was cold and lonesome and I desired to see more of the world than our small keep.</description>

        <description>The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I&amp;#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr.</description>

        <description>Allana&amp;#39;s sisters launches a hairbrained scheme to get her sister to learn social skills in hopes of helping her break free from her adorably shy nature. It has somewhat mixed results, but Tabitha absolutely won&amp;#39;t give up on her cute sister!</description>

        <description>If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.
From this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently.</description>

        <description>If you have followed my guides so far then you&amp;#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.
How best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too.</description>

        <description>After following my guide thus far you&amp;#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you&amp;#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.</description>

        <description>Hi hi 👋 You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over two years ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I was completely addicted 🤪 If I&amp;#39;m honest, Fiesta Online isn&amp;#39;t exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I&amp;#39;ve made friends and just can&amp;#39;t seem to leave them.</description>

        <description>I realized that, though there is a forum post too, a news article that just barely mentioned commissions was probably not enough to lay out all the information one &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; need to know to get started if they wanted to commission me. This page will rectify that. I will lay out what I am willing to draw, what I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; willing to draw, and how you can contact me if you are interested. I will also go over how I expect to be paid.</description>

        <description>As I work on various art assets, like stream overlays, frames, cards, and my vTubing model, I have settled on a kind of brand for myself that revolves around a few colors. While I love this site, its design, and the various color schemes available for it, I wonder if it will serve this kind of &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; that I am building for myself on Twitch. I&amp;#39;m thinking it would be best to make this site an extension of the brand.</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

        <description>In my Stream Recap for this week you won&amp;#39;t find a Persona 3 stream, but I did have one. It was a surprise stream and you can catch it on my Twitch page. I&amp;#39;ll also be in next week&amp;#39;s recap, probably. Anyway, I also worked a bit on the Persona 3 Reload Walkthrough this week.
The Stream Recap! You can see it my link! I have decided how I will handle news and stream schedules!</description>

        <description>Art Stream If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in last week&amp;#39;s news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure.</description>

        <description>If you&amp;#39;ve been around my site for awhile than you probably know that I am an artist and a writer. Well, I haven&amp;#39;t really been doing much writing of late, other than school papers, but I&amp;#39;m still a writer, okay? Well, anyway, I have a new hat! A streamer hat!</description>

        <description>I know last week&amp;#39;s new article sounded a little bleak and I even told you not to expect weekly updates any more, but, well here I am! I wanted to give myself a bit of an &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; because of how I was feeling. I&amp;#39;m still not feeling great, but I&amp;#39;m here and I am working on updates. Unfortunately, the one you will see will look like a removal of something and not updating or adding anything.</description>

        <description>Do you ever just have times in your life, or maybe just a day or a few hours, where you just don&amp;#39;t want to do anything? Like no matter what it is you are doing, even if its something that usually brings you a lot of joy or something you&amp;#39;re normally really passionate about, you just can&amp;#39;t seem to enjoy doing it. I&amp;#39;d honestly like to know if I&amp;#39;m the only one 😅 Well this has happened a few days this week and rather than coming up with something to update the site with, I decided I&amp;#39;d talk about this a little and the struggle with this one is so real for me.</description>

        <description>After finishing the easiest S-Link guide ever, I have to admit I have not really gone back 😅 I have mostly been playing through Persona3 Reload and P3P. Of course I still have work to do. Fortunately, it seems that the amount of work as decreased a bit since I am more used to the new processes. I also am still working on some stories and ADVENTURES, but most of that work isn&amp;#39;t seen until I&amp;#39;m ready to release it 😅</description>

        <description>I think they underworked me last quarter and now this quarter they decided to overwork me 😆 I&amp;#39;m kidding though, but only a little. I do have a lot more work to do this quarter each work than I did last quarter, but its not a terrible amount. I am hoping it gives me a little bit more hours and more money though. I&amp;#39;ll find this out on my next pay check.</description>

        <description>Forgive me for not having much to update this week. We did have a little fun with April Fool&amp;#39;s Day this year and that&amp;#39;s good enough for me, but I need to put out a bit of an update to see if I can clear that and I do have a few things to talk about so I figured I&amp;#39;d put out a small news article this week and focus on getting my work and shtuff ready for the next quarter.</description>

        <description>Working on my Persona guides, especially the Persona 4 Golden Social Link guides and working on my own professional development at the same time has got me thinking a little bit about the subject of building Social Networks. I&amp;#39;m not talking about Facebook, or Twitter, or even Mastodon, I&amp;#39;m talking about the relationships we build with each other over time much like the protagonists in a Persona game.
Progress! Before I go into that topic though I just wanted to let everyone know that I am making progress on transcribing my DnD adventures into Keyrie&amp;#39;s Journal.</description>

        <description>Okay maybe that&amp;#39;s not really that fair of a question, especially considering spring break literally just started, but, hey, it&amp;#39;s already Thursday! I mean come on I only get three weeks so what&amp;#39;s up with that!? I always come up with all sorts of things that I want to do accomplish during my breaks. Things that I don&amp;#39;t think I would have time to work on while I&amp;#39;m in class.</description>

        <description>&amp;nbsp; Persona 4 Golden is a faithful update to a classic game with new story elements and new characters. It has a classic story with interesting characters. The protagonist is a bit generic and the graphics are a little dated, but the story and gameplay more than make up for these minor gripes. If you like a game with a lot of charm and fun, I highly recommend Persona 4 Golden!</description>

        <description>Well, I had finished the main story of Persona 4 Golden. I have even managed to get the walkthrough down a bit and I think it fits okay in on part now, so I went and removed the second part. I also have started some work on the other guide sections. Mostly just got Marie up. So yeah I feel accomplished! After finishing P4G, I started P3P, but, before I even started writing this, I managed to get my hands on P3 Reload!</description>

        <description>I won&amp;#39;t give too much information about Teddie. Teddie is Teddie and Teddie is a party member and persona-user, somehow. You&amp;#39;ll automatically start and rank this social link during the story.
Availability Depending on how you look at it Teddie is not really ever available. You don&amp;#39;t get the option to hang out with him outside of story events and other S-Links. This isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing because it is actually one of the easiest S-Links to rank as it happens automatically during normal story events.</description>

Availability You&amp;#39;ll start this Social Link automatically 7/23 after you complete the Marukyu Striptease dungeon. You&amp;#39;ll usually find her on the first floor of the high school or in front of the tofu shop in the central shopping district on the days listed below.</description>

        <description>Nanako is Ryotaro Dojima&amp;#39;s daughter, which makes her your cousin. Though her age isn&amp;#39;t specified she appears to be between six and eight, but she is surprisingly mature for her age. This is probably because she had to grow up rather quickly after the death of her mother. Nanako&amp;#39;s story is very cute and was one of my favorites in to work through in my game. Her S-Link will start automatically as part of the game&amp;#39;s story.</description>

She usually sits on the other side of Igor, though some times she seems to be missing only to return fairly quickly usually after you discover one of her poems. After 04/18 you will see in option under &amp;#34;check on dwellers&amp;#34; in the velvet room to &amp;#34;listen to Marie&amp;#39;s request&amp;#34;. This will allow you to befriend Marie and start her social link.</description>

        <description>Its almost official. I am just about done with Persona 4 Golden. The walkthrough is up to the point just passed the Golden dungeon and that is the last dungeon I will be including in the walkthrough. I hear tales of a hidden dungeon, but I will not be testing those tales just yet nor will that be included in the walkthrough. So basically, the walkthrough is done. There is maybe a day or so left and that will be uploaded next week, but this begs the question of what is happening next.</description>

        <description>No, this isn&amp;#39;t a call for you to commission me more, though I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind if I got more commissions. I just wanted a funny title for this week&amp;#39;s news article and I do you have another commission done so, yeah let&amp;#39;s just have some fun! Of course you can still give me more commissions 😆
I Haz DA SNACKS!! Yes I do love snacks! I usually have nuts, or pocky, or Swedish Fish, or even Skittles Gummies to snack on throughout the day.</description>

        <description>Well, this was going to be a totally different and probably much shorter post, but then things happened. First, I did put the rant tag on just in case but I don&amp;#39;t really think this is going to be much of rant. Second I&amp;#39;m actually going to be mostly focusing on some new wellness things I&amp;#39;m doing to keep myself from going crazy and not so much on what happened with Hugo.</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;m sure you all remember this Little elf right? You might even remember that I teased a new little section for my adventures. Well its here and its all thanks to a new D&amp;amp;D campaign I&amp;#39;ve entered! I typically play D&amp;amp;D on Saturday nights and I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying it so far. It is just a little extra thing for me to do to keep myself connected socially because I&amp;#39;m not one who really like going out 😅</description>

        <description>I have 10 max S-Links in Persona 4 Golden \ ( ^ o ^ ) / Just had to say it, lol. That should give you an indication that I have started playing it again. which I have. I&amp;#39;m mostly just working on my S-Links and trying to get through some of the extra post-game content while I wait for things to pick up again. You would think I&amp;#39;d be used to this kind of thing knowing that I also like visual novels, but, for some reason this sort of thing is just not so fun in Persona.</description>

        <description>Yep just a little update this week, but at least I have some actual new content. It has been awhile since I updated any of my stories, but hopefully I&amp;#39;ll get something up soon. With all that has been going on, I really haven&amp;#39;t been in the mood for writing. In fact, if Keyrie wasn&amp;#39;t something I had already started and nearly finished I wouldn&amp;#39;t have finished that either. I do have another project I had started, but haven&amp;#39;t worked on because I haven&amp;#39;t felt like working on it much either.</description>

        <description>This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.</description>

        <description>I am committed to making sure there is something new on this site every week even if there isn&amp;#39;t much! There will probably be some things coming up next week, but this week was quite a bit busier than it appeared on screen, particularly today. I still have a few things to finish, but at least work is over 😅
Only a News Article? Yes, I have to apologize, I had a lot to do this week for work and school and those are all just a bit more important than this site.</description>

        <description>It seems I have completed the last main dungeon for Persona 4 Golden. I&amp;#39;m planning on bringing my walkthrough up to that point today or tomorrow. Now, there is still the matter of, what I believe is, the Golden content. This is the part about finding Marie that, if memory serves (as I don&amp;#39;t think she was even in the original) was added for the Golden re-release. So I still have content to work through, but its almost there.</description>

        <description>Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the Persona 4 Golden walkthrough. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information.</description>

        <description>This is the first time I&amp;#39;m late since starting my weekly updates. It has been a crazy day! Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not too late, but I had a lot of work to do and a lot of other plans. Also I may have spent too long trying to get notes off my Steam Deck so I could update the Persona 4 Golden walkthrough and not enough time actually updating the website 😅</description>

        <description>I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I could release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to.</description>

        <description>Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something 😅 The thing was…this site 😆 Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities.</description>

        <description>For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!</description>

        <description>Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there&amp;#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut 😉) next week.</description>

        <description>Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics.</description>

        <description>This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun…as long as you ignore the last heading that is 😜
New Position As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology.</description>

        <description>This site now has a lot of news articles! I guess one article each week for almost a year will do that. As a result, I made a few changes to how the news section is organized. You probably won&amp;#39;t notice anything, unless you link to an article. Sorry for all the links I just broke 😅
What Changed!? All articles in this section used to just be in the &amp;#39;news&amp;#39; folder with the date as the file name.</description>

        <description>The month of October, also known as Spooky Month, is over. Halloween was one of my favorite holidays, but I, sadly, didn&amp;#39;t do much this year. I am still sad to see the month go and, I was also reminded, there are only two months left in the year 😲. 2023 has gone by fast, huh?
Obligatory RE[BASE] update For reasons I&amp;#39;ll get into a bit later, you will not be seeing a new episode of RE[BASE] this week.</description>

        <description>Just kidding, I discovered those a long time ago 😝 Actually, what&amp;#39;s funny is that some of my favorite JRPGS are also marked as visual novels, at least according to Steam. For some of them I can actually see that. Like Hyper Dimension Neptunia, or Fairy Fencer. Those do have some RPG elements to them, like building and leveling your characters and exploring dungeons, but most of the story is</description>

        <description>I guess I&amp;#39;ll start with a confession. There will be no episode of RE[BASE] this week. I&amp;#39;d like to point out that I said that I won&amp;#39;t necessarily be trying to maintain the once-a-week pace for episode releases. I also mentioned that releasing the first three episodes on that schedule was more because I was on break and had a lot of time. So, I would like to say its because I started back in classes so I don&amp;#39;t have the time I did when I was on break, but that&amp;#39;s not really true 😅</description>

        <description>Breaks always seem to go by way too fast. I mean I get three weeks between terms, but those same three weeks always seem to go by faster and faster. Fortunately, the first couple weeks of a new term are always fairly light so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry so much right away. This week has been light enough that I&amp;#39;ve been able to do a lot of extra things.</description>

        <description>I am feeling quite lazy, have been for the last few days. To be fair to myself, I have made progress on all of projects and completed many a to-do item, but I really had to force myself to do some of them. I actually finished episode two of RE[BASE] sometime just after I published the first episode so that will be going up this week. I even started episode three, but I didn&amp;#39;t make as much progress as I wanted and I haven&amp;#39;t played the games I wanted to play this week either.</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep,
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.</description>

        <description>During my break I decided to do some productive things instead of just playing video games. I mean I do that too, but not just that 😝 One of those new things is getting back in to creative writing. While this week&amp;#39;s update likely won&amp;#39;t feature it, I have started a new series of short stories. Of course I&amp;#39;m also now about halfway through Persona 4 Golden so I&amp;#39;ve been updating my guide for that finally!</description>

        <description>Hello!
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in 😆 Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!</description>

        <description>Well, as of writing this I am still technically writing a thing. I started it thought so, yeah…😆 Anyway, aside from writing a new ADVENTURE, I also made a few more adjustments to my fiesta leveling guide. This week though it is mostly about writing!
About the adjustments After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides.</description>

        <description>This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!
I want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe.</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>First No Man&amp;#39;s Sky actually has a story! I know this came as a bit of a surprise to me too. Basically you are a Traveller and you wake up on a planet with no memory of how you got there, just your exosuit and your starship. You will go through and explore the world, build a base, and try to learn what happened to you. It is this last part that provides us with a surprisingly deep story that I was really not prepared for, but am pleasantly surprised is there!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>In Little Witch Nobeta you play as a little witch who lost her memory. She goes on a journey to the one place she remembers, a throne in a giant castle, in hopes of finding her memory. Along the way she meets a cat who is very insistent that she makes it to the throne!</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome to another update!
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve.</description>

        <description>So I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely wrong! I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!
Maze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻 During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep!
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform.</description>

        <description>While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself.</description>

        <description>When I first wrote my last guide the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next. Well cap is 140 now so I guess it&amp;#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. So, here&amp;#39;s some ideas of what you can do. The same caveat exists with this guide as with the last one. My current highest level character is 140, but she is a cleric, so I have not tried some of these suggestions alone.</description>

        <description>Before we begin, it is important to understand that everything in Fiesta is divided into tiers, this includes weapons, armor, and jewlery. Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones.</description>
