        <description>The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I&amp;#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr.</description>

        <description>Allana&amp;#39;s sisters launches a hairbrained scheme to get her sister to learn social skills in hopes of helping her break free from her adorably shy nature. It has somewhat mixed results, but Tabitha absolutely won&amp;#39;t give up on her cute sister!</description>

        <description>If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.
From this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently.</description>

        <description>If you have followed my guides so far then you&amp;#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.
How best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too.</description>

        <description>After following my guide thus far you&amp;#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you&amp;#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.</description>

        <description>Hi hi 👋 You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over two years ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I was completely addicted 🤪 If I&amp;#39;m honest, Fiesta Online isn&amp;#39;t exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I&amp;#39;ve made friends and just can&amp;#39;t seem to leave them.</description>

        <description>I realized that, though there is a forum post too, a news article that just barely mentioned commissions was probably not enough to lay out all the information one &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; need to know to get started if they wanted to commission me. This page will rectify that. I will lay out what I am willing to draw, what I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; willing to draw, and how you can contact me if you are interested. I will also go over how I expect to be paid.</description>

        <description>This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.</description>

        <description>I am committed to making sure there is something new on this site every week even if there isn&amp;#39;t much! There will probably be some things coming up next week, but this week was quite a bit busier than it appeared on screen, particularly today. I still have a few things to finish, but at least work is over 😅
Only a News Article? Yes, I have to apologize, I had a lot to do this week for work and school and those are all just a bit more important than this site.</description>

        <title>Persona 4 Golden is Over... Maybe?</title>

        <description>It seems I have completed the last main dungeon for Persona 4 Golden. I&amp;#39;m planning on bringing my walkthrough up to that point today or tomorrow. Now, there is still the matter of, what I believe is, the Golden content. This is the part about finding Marie that, if memory serves (as I don&amp;#39;t think she was even in the original) was added for the Golden re-release. So I still have content to work through, but its almost there.</description>

        <description>Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the Persona 4 Golden walkthrough. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information.</description>

        <description>This is the first time I&amp;#39;m late since starting my weekly updates. It has been a crazy day! Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not too late, but I had a lot of work to do and a lot of other plans. Also I may have spent too long trying to get notes off my Steam Deck so I could update the Persona 4 Golden walkthrough and not enough time actually updating the website 😅</description>

        <description>I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I could release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to.</description>

        <description>Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something 😅 The thing was…this site 😆 Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities.</description>

        <description>For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!</description>

        <description>Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there&amp;#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut 😉) next week.</description>

        <description>Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics.</description>

        <description>This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun…as long as you ignore the last heading that is 😜
New Position As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology.</description>

        <description>This site now has a lot of news articles! I guess one article each week for almost a year will do that. As a result, I made a few changes to how the news section is organized. You probably won&amp;#39;t notice anything, unless you link to an article. Sorry for all the links I just broke 😅
What Changed!? All articles in this section used to just be in the &amp;#39;news&amp;#39; folder with the date as the file name.</description>

        <description>The month of October, also known as Spooky Month, is over. Halloween was one of my favorite holidays, but I, sadly, didn&amp;#39;t do much this year. I am still sad to see the month go and, I was also reminded, there are only two months left in the year 😲. 2023 has gone by fast, huh?
Obligatory RE[BASE] update For reasons I&amp;#39;ll get into a bit later, you will not be seeing a new episode of RE[BASE] this week.</description>

        <description>Just kidding, I discovered those a long time ago 😝 Actually, what&amp;#39;s funny is that some of my favorite JRPGS are also marked as visual novels, at least according to Steam. For some of them I can actually see that. Like Hyper Dimension Neptunia, or Fairy Fencer. Those do have some RPG elements to them, like building and leveling your characters and exploring dungeons, but most of the story is</description>

        <description>I guess I&amp;#39;ll start with a confession. There will be no episode of RE[BASE] this week. I&amp;#39;d like to point out that I said that I won&amp;#39;t necessarily be trying to maintain the once-a-week pace for episode releases. I also mentioned that releasing the first three episodes on that schedule was more because I was on break and had a lot of time. So, I would like to say its because I started back in classes so I don&amp;#39;t have the time I did when I was on break, but that&amp;#39;s not really true 😅</description>

        <description>Breaks always seem to go by way too fast. I mean I get three weeks between terms, but those same three weeks always seem to go by faster and faster. Fortunately, the first couple weeks of a new term are always fairly light so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry so much right away. This week has been light enough that I&amp;#39;ve been able to do a lot of extra things.</description>

        <description>I am feeling quite lazy, have been for the last few days. To be fair to myself, I have made progress on all of projects and completed many a to-do item, but I really had to force myself to do some of them. I actually finished episode two of RE[BASE] sometime just after I published the first episode so that will be going up this week. I even started episode three, but I didn&amp;#39;t make as much progress as I wanted and I haven&amp;#39;t played the games I wanted to play this week either.</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep,
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.</description>

        <description>During my break I decided to do some productive things instead of just playing video games. I mean I do that too, but not just that 😝 One of those new things is getting back in to creative writing. While this week&amp;#39;s update likely won&amp;#39;t feature it, I have started a new series of short stories. Of course I&amp;#39;m also now about halfway through Persona 4 Golden so I&amp;#39;ve been updating my guide for that finally!</description>

        <description>Hello!
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in 😆 Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!</description>

        <description>Well, as of writing this I am still technically writing a thing. I started it thought so, yeah…😆 Anyway, aside from writing a new ADVENTURE, I also made a few more adjustments to my fiesta leveling guide. This week though it is mostly about writing!
About the adjustments After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides.</description>

        <description>This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!
I want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe.</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>First No Man&amp;#39;s Sky actually has a story! I know this came as a bit of a surprise to me too. Basically you are a Traveller and you wake up on a planet with no memory of how you got there, just your exosuit and your starship. You will go through and explore the world, build a base, and try to learn what happened to you. It is this last part that provides us with a surprisingly deep story that I was really not prepared for, but am pleasantly surprised is there!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>In Little Witch Nobeta you play as a little witch who lost her memory. She goes on a journey to the one place she remembers, a throne in a giant castle, in hopes of finding her memory. Along the way she meets a cat who is very insistent that she makes it to the throne!</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome to another update!
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve.</description>

        <description>So I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely wrong! I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!
Maze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻 During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep!
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform.</description>

        <description>While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself.</description>

        <description>When I first wrote my last guide the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next. Well cap is 140 now so I guess it&amp;#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. So, here&amp;#39;s some ideas of what you can do. The same caveat exists with this guide as with the last one. My current highest level character is 140, but she is a cleric, so I have not tried some of these suggestions alone.</description>

        <description>Before we begin, it is important to understand that everything in Fiesta is divided into tiers, this includes weapons, armor, and jewlery. Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones.</description>

        <description>The Lucky House can be entered by speaking to the Lucky House Guide in the following towns:
Elderine Uruga Alberstroll Ruins Note: Your character must be at least level 40 to enter the Lucky House.
The Lucky House is a place where you can exchange in-game gems, gold, etc for coins that can be used for a variety of gambling games. These games are pretty entertaining for a bit and, like all gambling, are a way to win more coins to exchange for gems.</description>

        <description>At level 95 you can begin doing daily quests. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 in-game time, meaning once you turn them in they are done, but you can pick em up again the next day. From levels 90-125 you can pick up quests by purchasing a mission scroll from the mission board in Elderine. Talk to Verylo (who is standing next to the board) to actually pick up the quest.</description>
