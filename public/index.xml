        <description>The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I&amp;#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr.</description>

        <description>If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.
From this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently.</description>

        <description>If you have followed my guides so far then you&amp;#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.
How best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too.</description>

        <description>After following my guide thus far you&amp;#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you&amp;#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.</description>

        <description>Hi hi 👋 You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over two years ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I was completely addicted 🤪 If I&amp;#39;m honest, Fiesta Online isn&amp;#39;t exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I&amp;#39;ve made friends and just can&amp;#39;t seem to leave them.</description>

        <title>About Commissions</title>

        <description>I realized that, though there is a forum post too, a news article that just barely mentioned commissions was probably not enough to lay out all the information one &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; need to know to get started if they wanted to commission me. This page will rectify that. I will lay out what I am willing to draw, what I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; willing to draw, and how you can contact me if you are interested. I will also go over how I expect to be paid.</description>

        <description>Well, as of writing this I am still technically writing a thing. I started it thought so, yeah…😆 Anyway, aside from writing a new ADVENTURE, I also made a few more adjustments to my fiesta leveling guide. This week though it is mostly about writing!
About the adjustments After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides.</description>

        <description>This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!
I want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe.</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>First No Man&amp;#39;s Sky actually has a story! I know this came as a bit of a surprise to me too. Basically you are a Traveller and you wake up on a planet with no memory of how you got there, just your exosuit and your starship. You will go through and explore the world, build a base, and try to learn what happened to you. It is this last part that provides us with a surprisingly deep story that I was really not prepared for, but am pleasantly surprised is there!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>In Little Witch Nobeta you play as a little witch who lost her memory. She goes on a journey to the one place she remembers, a throne in a giant castle, in hopes of finding her memory. Along the way she meets a cat who is very insistent that she makes it to the throne!</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome to another update!
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve.</description>

        <description>So I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely wrong! I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!
Maze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻 During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep!
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform.</description>

        <description>While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself.</description>

        <description>When I first wrote my last guide the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next. Well cap is 140 now so I guess it&amp;#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. So, here&amp;#39;s some ideas of what you can do. The same caveat exists with this guide as with the last one. My current highest level character is 140, but she is a cleric, so I have not tried some of these suggestions alone.</description>

        <description>Before we begin, it is important to understand that everything in Fiesta is divided into tiers, this includes weapons, armor, and jewlery. Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones.</description>

        <description>The Lucky House can be entered by speaking to the Lucky House Guide in the following towns:
Elderine Uruga Alberstroll Ruins Note: Your character must be at least level 40 to enter the Lucky House.
The Lucky House is a place where you can exchange in-game gems, gold, etc for coins that can be used for a variety of gambling games. These games are pretty entertaining for a bit and, like all gambling, are a way to win more coins to exchange for gems.</description>

        <description>At level 95 you can begin doing daily quests. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 in-game time, meaning once you turn them in they are done, but you can pick em up again the next day. From levels 90-125 you can pick up quests by purchasing a mission scroll from the mission board in Elderine. Talk to Verylo (who is standing next to the board) to actually pick up the quest.</description>
