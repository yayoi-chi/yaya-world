        <description>&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/~yayoi/gallery/creations/KeyriePP.png&#34; alt=&#34;Keyrie&amp;#39;s Portrait&#34; title=&#34;Keyrie Cildor&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; width=&#34;35%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am Keyrie Cildor. I come from a privileged and noble line of wood elves. I am not large of stature, standing at only five feet and a single inch as measured by the humans, but I have a fierce heart for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world. The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity. It is my responsibility to respect the authority of those above just as expect from those below. I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling and privilege of my family. I am loyal to my sovereign and my subjects regard me as a hero. Though loyal and respectful in person, I often find thoughts of privilege creeping into my mind reminding me that I am above all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on. However, the group did encounter someone in Sea of Greed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
