Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven&amp;#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I&amp;#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it 😅 I haven&amp;#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
