        <description>Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the Persona 4 Golden walkthrough. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information.</description>

        <description>This is the first time I&amp;#39;m late since starting my weekly updates. It has been a crazy day! Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not too late, but I had a lot of work to do and a lot of other plans. Also I may have spent too long trying to get notes off my Steam Deck so I could update the Persona 4 Golden walkthrough and not enough time actually updating the website 😅</description>

        <description>I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I could release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to.</description>

        <description>Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something 😅 The thing was…this site 😆 Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities.</description>

        <description>For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!</description>

        <description>Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there&amp;#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut 😉) next week.</description>

        <description>Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics.</description>

        <description>This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun…as long as you ignore the last heading that is 😜
New Position As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology.</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep,
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.</description>

        <description>Hello!
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in 😆 Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!</description>

        <description>This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!
I want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe.</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome to another update!
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻 During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep!
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform.</description>
