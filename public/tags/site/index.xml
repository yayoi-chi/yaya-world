        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last week I &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/news/2024/announcing-announcement/&#34;&gt;announced some announcements&lt;/a&gt;, well it is finally time to actually make those announcements. Technically, I already made them they were in a stream that is available on the YouTube channel, but I thought I should also right them out here and in the Discord. Though I already wrote them out in the Discord. It&amp;#39;s much easier to post things quickly there, which I may have also mentioned last week. Anyway what I announced was:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>This is just a short notice! Last week, I did a test stream on YouTube. While the game itself didn&amp;#39;t cooperate, the stream worked very well. In fact I enjoyed it! I think my flow just works better with YouTube. I don&amp;#39;t plan on leaving Twitch anytime soon, but I&amp;#39;ll be doing exclusive streams on both YouTube and Twitch.</description>

You may notice that this is coming out late and, if you&amp;#39;re really observant it was created &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the stream recap for this week. I had originally been trying to get the recaps out on Thursday, but this meant some weirdness in what was covered in the recaps and what was scheduled because a Thursday release meant I would work on them on Wednesday, in the middle of the week, and my schedule was (and still is) written for Monday through Sunday. I moved the release to Friday, but that still doesn&amp;#39;t really work, so I&amp;#39;m making another change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As I work on various art assets, like stream overlays, frames, cards, and my vTubing model, I have settled on a kind of brand for myself that revolves around a few colors. While I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this site, its design, and the various color schemes available for it, I wonder if it will serve this kind of &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; that I am building for myself on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi&#34;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m thinking it would be best to make this site an extension of the brand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/news/2024/stream-recap-week-1/&#34;&gt;Stream Recap&lt;/a&gt; for this week you won&amp;#39;t find a Persona 3 stream, but I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have one. It was a surprise stream and you can catch it on my Twitch page. I&amp;#39;ll also be in next week&amp;#39;s recap, probably. Anyway, I also worked a bit on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/guides/p3reload/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 3 Reload Walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The Stream Recap!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it my link! I have decided how I will handle news and stream schedules! There will be essentially &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; tags &amp;#34;news&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;recap&amp;#34; but you don&amp;#39;t have to know that unless you&amp;#39;re looking specifically for streaming news versus regular news. You can also just look at the tag &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; for everything to do with streams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>If you&amp;#39;ve been around my site for awhile than you probably know that I am an artist and a writer. Well, I haven&amp;#39;t really been doing much writing of late, other than school papers, but I&amp;#39;m still a writer, okay? Well, anyway, I have a new hat! A streamer hat!</description>

I know &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/news/2024/case-of-the-mehs/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; new article sounded a little bleak and I even told you not to expect weekly updates any more, but, well here I am! I wanted to give myself a bit of an &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; because of how I was feeling. I&amp;#39;m still not feeling great, but I&amp;#39;m here and I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; working on updates. Unfortunately, the one you will see will look like a removal of something and not updating or adding anything. Don&amp;#39;t worry, it will be back later and in greater numbers ð&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Okay maybe that&amp;#39;s not really that fair of a question, especially considering spring break literally just started, but, hey, it&amp;#39;s already Thursday! I mean come on I only get three weeks so what&amp;#39;s up with that!? I always come up with all sorts of things that I want to do accomplish during my breaks. Things that I don&amp;#39;t think I would have time to work on while I&amp;#39;m in class. However, its already Thursday of the first week and I haven&amp;#39;t really made much of a dent. That said, there are still quite a few things I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; worked on this week!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, this was going to be a totally different and probably much shorter post, but then things happened. First, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; put the rant tag on just in case but I don&amp;#39;t really think this is going to be much of rant. Second I&amp;#39;m actually going to be mostly focusing on some new wellness things I&amp;#39;m doing to keep myself from going crazy and not so much on what happened with Hugo. That, however, will be the first little header here so if you want to skip it, you can just go to the next header listed in the &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s on this page&amp;#34; list to the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have 10 max S-Links in Persona 4 Golden \ ( ^ o ^ ) / Just had to say it, lol. That should give you an indication that I have started playing it again. which I have. I&amp;#39;m mostly just working on my S-Links and trying to get through some of the extra post-game content while I wait for things to pick up again. You would think I&amp;#39;d be used to this kind of thing knowing that I also like visual novels, but, for some reason this sort of thing is just not so fun in Persona. Its a big part of it and part of the appeal for some, I suppose, but, in this quantity not so fun. Actually Persona got me thinking about something else lately. So I guess it&amp;#39;s time for another Yaya rant ð Feel free to skip the first heading if you just want the site updates. Though I promise this rant will be less angry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Persona 4 Golden is Over... Maybe?</title>

It seems I have completed the last main dungeon for Persona 4 Golden. I&amp;#39;m planning on bringing my walkthrough up to that point today or tomorrow. Now, there is still the matter of, what I believe is, the Golden content. This is the part about finding Marie that, if memory serves (as I don&amp;#39;t think she was even in the original) was added for the Golden re-release. So I still have content to work through, but its almost there. Also, I would like to point out that I have a reference generated for a new personal project and I plan on starting that tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information. Things like when Marie will be available and other commentary will be moved to other sections, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/guides/p4g/slink/&#34;&gt;Social Links&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/guides/p4g/quests/&#34;&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;. As for other news, I have finished a game! Look forward to a new review and many more in 2024!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is the first time I&amp;#39;m late since starting my weekly updates. It has been a crazy day! Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not too late, but I had a lot of work to do and a lot of other plans. Also I may have spent too long trying to get notes off my Steam Deck so I could update the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; and not enough time actually updating the website ð&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Looking Back
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in 2023. I quit working as Behavior Technician to focus more on my school work, I completed the first (of many) dissertation milestones, and I became a Graduate Assistant and a commissioned artist. Becoming a commissioned artist renewed my love of art and drawing and I have produced more pictures this year than I have in any year for the past few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to. I actually had a total of three Christmas projects, but none will be leaked here early, I can guarantee that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something ð The thing wasâ¦this site ð Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities. It would be different if I had an idea for something like a new episode of RE[BASE] and was postponing that, but I just got an idea for another episode for Nagisa&amp;#39;s story today, so not really behind yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there&amp;#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut ð) next week. Plus a few more announcements I&amp;#39;m working on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics. I also hope to add more VNs that I have on my Steam wishlist to the reviews. I&amp;#39;m still working on finishing Persona 4 Golden, but I focused more on getting homework done this week so I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall behind during the holiday. I will be putting up the commissions I finished last week though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly funâ¦as long as you ignore the last heading that is ð&lt;/p&gt;

New Position
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology. Previously I was working as an ABA therapist. This work was fun, but it was also beginning to be too much. I was having difficulty focusing on my client&amp;#39;s needs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my schoolwork.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello everypeep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in ð Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!?&amp;#34; and get all depressed, so I won&amp;#39;t do that. I&amp;#39;ll just continue to be happy that I make an effort every week to at least post a news article!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/commissions/&#34;&gt;about commissions&lt;/a&gt; page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
I want commissions!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I get paid so win-win maybe. Anyway, I know I mentioned them a little bit in the last news article, but I felt that I didn&amp;#39;t really give them enough attention, so I added a dedicated page that talks about them in a bit more detail. This includes things I feel I&amp;#39;m good at and am more than willing to draw for you as well as things I absolutely won&amp;#39;t draw. I also go into more detail on how to get a hold of me and how payments are likely to work. This was only one addition though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello and welcome to another update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve. This week, there is no new review, but I plan on writing one for Little Witch Nobeta fairly soon as I just completed that game. I didn&amp;#39;t do everything, but I did finish the main story so I feel qualified to review it now. You can look forward to that review in next week&amp;#39;s update!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hi hi everypeep ðð»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven&amp;#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I&amp;#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it ð I haven&amp;#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hello everypeep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform. First, I guess I little background information is in order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
