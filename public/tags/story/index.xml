        <description>&lt;p&gt;
While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on. However, the group did encounter someone in Sea of Greed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
