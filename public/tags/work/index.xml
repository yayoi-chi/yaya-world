        <description>I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I could release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to.</description>

        <description>Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something ðŸ˜… The thing wasâ€¦this site ðŸ˜† Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities.</description>
