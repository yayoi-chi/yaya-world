        <description>A slightly shorter week this week because of a holiday. We still managed to work on our comic page during Maker Monday and managed an exclusive stream on YouTube. Other than that we finished our bank heist and even got back to the future (sort of). So a good week, methinks!</description>

        <description>Two art stream fun again! We first worked on page 7 of my comic then we played a few games, including Xenosaga and Genshin, then I finished up some wings for sub-badges and worked a bit more on page seven of the comic. Overall it was a fun week delving into timey-whimey and mysterious shtuff. More mysteries soon, but hopefully we will get back to our own time in Xenosaga too! Also, let&amp;#39;s rob a bank, doesn&amp;#39;t that sound fun?</description>

        <description>Art streams are going very well! I really like getting the opportunity to chat while working on random art projects or my comic. I still play games though, because I like playing games too! This week we located some intel in Persona 5, solved more mysteries in Genshin Impact, and uncovered the past in Xenosaga Episode III. I didn&amp;#39;t realize it was such a mystery-filled week! Much fun though, methinks</description>

        <description>Transforming back into mostly an art streamer, slowly. We had an outfit reveal this week, but I also did some random art then and I did some more random art the next day. This left only three days for game streams, but I think that&amp;#39;s okay. I like the art streams and, we did get our paws on Cartethyia!!</description>

        <description>Took a bit of an extra break this week so we only did three game streams. We also began the great experiment to multistream. This started with the art stream and continued for most streams. We streamed Wuthering Waves, Xenosaga Episode III (actual gameplay), and Genshin Impact. Hope every kitten had fun!</description>

        <description>Wow! Our little experiment with Wuthering Waves was a good success! Also, look at that, we made it to Xenosaga Episode III. In terms of story, Episode I is my favorite, but I like how III plays. We also made it to Fontaine. It was a good week!</description>

        <description>Lots of good stuff happened this week. We did two panels so now we just have one left for Page 6. We also finished Xenosage Episode II in one of my longest streams since Ghost Cat&amp;#39;s takeover. We got distracted a couple of time too. Lots of good and fun stuff!</description>

        <description>Back to four game streams this week and (spoiler warning) probably next week too. This week included a fun and exciting collab with Bsparkx in Genshin and a Wuthering Waves stream. We&amp;#39;re also very close to finishing Xenosaga Episode II!</description>

        <description>Another shorter week, but a lot happened. We found the next treasure in Persona 5 Royal (though our route isn&amp;#39;t secure yet). We got through Labyrinthos in Xenosaga Episode II. We even managed not only a few main story quests in Wuthering Waves, but also a couple event quests! Busy busy week!</description>

        <description>A pretty normal week. Hope every kitten is getting used to the new routine. We had a great art stream working on new panels for page six of my comic. We also found a new target in Persona 5 Royal and made it to Laborythos in Xenosaga Episode II. My favorite though was probably our Genshin stream where I got to trail Nahida.</description>

        <description>Pretty normal week. I went down to four streams this week and I think that went pretty well. I technically have two days set aside for collabs, but decided for this week (and next) to just leave those days open. Still had great fun with Wuthering Waves, Persona 5 Royal, and Xenosaga. Also Page 6 let&amp;#39;s go!</description>

        <description>Overall a good week this week! I didn&amp;#39;t get back to my comic just yet, but I did create a new PNGTuber for when I stream things on the Mac and it can&amp;#39;t handle everything (looking at you Wuthering Waves). I also got back to Persona 5 Royal, where we discovered it is possible to change someone&amp;#39;s heart. I ended the week by finally rescuing Nahida!</description>

        <description>No art stream this week, but we did reveal a new outfit! Other than that, it was a good week of game streams. We found out that Aneeta Job doesn&amp;#39;t need that same job, and we got her something new to do. We also had some fun with event quests in Wuthering Waves, and even finished the castle in Persona 5 Royal. See, not a bad week!</description>

        <description>Lots of fun this week! I did a really fun April Fool&amp;#39;s prank on Tuesday and had a much better Wuthering Waves stream on Wednesday. We made more progress in Xenosaga Episode 2, and even nepped a lot of neps on Friday! Great times!</description>

        <description>A typical art stream and a wonderful collab with Bsparkx playing Wuthering Waves. Well it would have been wonderful if my frames didn&amp;#39;t drop so hard. We made it through and we even managed to start Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters this week!</description>

        <description>New week, new collab! Tried to get it so everyone could hear my collab partner (Bsparkx), but was still good. Also started Persona 5. I was reminded how much I like that game and am very excited to share it with the Kittens!</description>

        <description>Well, the scary uncertainty of last week is all over and done with and we even managed a fairly normal stream week even without a schedule. We had an art stream and even went back to Xenosaga and Kirby! Not bad for not knowing if and when I could stream, no?</description>

        <description>A very short week this week. Lots of things happened outside of my life as a streamer. It was all kind of overwhelming. I did manage a good art stream and we finished Persona 3 Reload. That was all though. Also, there&amp;#39;s more bad news, but I&amp;#39;ll leave it out of this summary!</description>

        <description>Took a small break from the comic to do a new outfit for my smol pngtuber! I kinda just wanted something I could do in one stream, and I did 🎉 I also played a new game, Kirby Star Allies, and continued the fun in both Persona 3 Reload and Xenosaga Episode 2. Also, some more Genshin stuff! Was a pretty good week, methinks.</description>

        <description>The experiment…didn&amp;#39;t help. I think maybe I just don&amp;#39;t have enough data points. We did finish quite a few things this week though! Xenosaga Episode 1, Sonic Generations, and the fourth comic page 🎉 Overall, not a bad week. Just need to figure out how to handle Genshin Impact…</description>

        <description>Collab with @Bsparkx went super well! I always end up spending a lot of resin when I play with her, but it is because we have so much fun poking things! I also completed the giant robot in Xenosaga! We&amp;#39;re almost ready for the end. Still trudging along on page 4 of the comic too! Almost done there as well.</description>

        <description>This was supposed to be a typical four game streams and one art stream week, but guess what? Things took an exciting turn! We got an extra Genshin stream! I was so excited because I needed it to finish Lantern Rite quests, and I’m happy to say I did it!</description>

        <description>A complicated week! Rather than two art streams, I did two Genshin streams, but I ended up canceling my Throwback Thursday 😅 Still managed to get out of Sumeru City and on to this years Lantern Rite!</description>

        <description>I did a practice thing! You won&amp;#39;t find this practice thing here, or anywhere, you had to be there live! I did it though. You know something you can see though? I started a new comic page! Also I got myself stuck in Genshin 😅</description>

        <description>A much more typical week after taking so much time off for holidays! We finished another page, started another illustration, went back to Hollownest, and more! I enjoyed getting to spend more time with the kittens! Hope you enjoyed it too~ 💜</description>

        <description>I revealed a new outfit! That&amp;#39;s pretty much the most exciting thing about this week. I mean sure, it was the first week of 2025, but that&amp;#39;s not all that exciting, no? I mean we did play Xenosaga and we did beat Exdeath and finish Final Fantasy V, but that wasn&amp;#39;t that exciting either, right? A new outfit though…</description>

        <description>We did some art and we did a bit of gaming. The week was sort because of the holidays. Also a lot of personal thing happened and, well, Portal 2 somehow turned into Genshin here! Still managed to have fun though!</description>

        <description>With the special project done, I returned to my comic! We laid out the third page and started the first panel. I only did the one art stream though so that meant we did both Final Fantasy and Persona this week! I also ended the week with co-op in Portal 2 for the first time!</description>

        <description>Two art streams! I really like being an art streamer! Finished the project though. In other news, games happened. We played Xenosaga, Persona, and Final Fantasy. Classic games for me! Almost done with pretty much all three!</description>

        <description>This week I started a special project that serves as a Christmas present for Ya-Ma and Ya-Pa! I also made more progress in Persona 3 Reload and Xenosaga, but I ended the week with another fun collab with Bsparkx!</description>

        <description>Two art streams are going the norm for awhile, methinks. Also, due to Thanksgiving in the US, I only had two game streams. Two and two!</description>

        <description>I had my first collabrative stream ever! It was a lot of fun! I hope for more of these in the future, especially with the awesome Bsparkx! In other news, there was also two art streams, and there probably will be for near future!</description>

        <description>After banishing Ghost Cat for the year, I have returned to a more normal lineup of wonderful games. Well, so far I really just did some announcements and played Final Fantasy V, but it was a nice change of pace. I hope everyone enjoyed Spooky Month!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last week I &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/announcing-announcement/&#34;&gt;announced some announcements&lt;/a&gt;, well it is finally time to actually make those announcements. Technically, I already made them they were in a stream that is available on the YouTube channel, but I thought I should also right them out here and in the Discord. Though I already wrote them out in the Discord. It&amp;#39;s much easier to post things quickly there, which I may have also mentioned last week. Anyway what I announced was:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>Sick week of sickness was not fun, not fun at all. Two of my streams were canceled this week due to illness. Still, I did manage to finish the rat game, and two canceled means three went up, so that&amp;#39;s good, right?</description>

        <description>Worked on a couple of new emotes and had a lot of fun with spooky games, except Corpose Party. Let&amp;#39;s just say, I&amp;#39;m glad I decided not to play it during the night 😅</description>

        <description>Not only did I create a few fairy wings and a head pat emote this week, but this was also the official debut of ghost cat! What are her intentions with my stream? Who even is she? I guess we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and find out!</description>

        <description>I needed two art streams to do one project this week! Well, maybe only one and half, but I made it two. I also streamed a bit more on YouTube this week, and I messed around with on screen chat there. Next week will be more on Twitch, cuz I&amp;#39;m affiliate!</description>

        <description>This is just a short notice! Last week, I did a test stream on YouTube. While the game itself didn&amp;#39;t cooperate, the stream worked very well. In fact I enjoyed it! I think my flow just works better with YouTube. I don&amp;#39;t plan on leaving Twitch anytime soon, but I&amp;#39;ll be doing exclusive streams on both YouTube and Twitch.</description>

        <description>Mostly a normal week this week. Did a fun Maker Monday stream with elemental-themed icons and played a lot of fun games. You will not see Final Fantasy here…I had to cancel that stream.</description>

        <description>Tried another day with two streams. Worked out a bit better! Well, probably because I had a holiday, but still. Really fun week that even included finishing Pokemon Sword!</description>

        <description>Shorter week because of a carpet install. Everything is looking great though and I&amp;#39;m loving my new room. I managed an art stream before the install and a few game streams after! Still a pretty nice week.</description>

        <description>Another two art streams in one week, but only one stream per day. The week was definitely not as hectic as the last week. We went back to Hollow Knight and Xenosaga, but started the next the Final Fantasy game!</description>

        <description>Did a new thing by splitting Saturday with a game stream in the afternoon and an art stream at night. Was a little hectic and probably not worth it so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll do something like that again unless I have a special event. Also I beat Final Fantasy IV!</description>

        <description>A week of new things! Started the week making a new frame for art streams and a new pngtuber for them too. Off stream I created a new game stream frame which debuted during a Persona stream and I even played a new game (well new for the channel)!</description>

        <description>Back to a regular stream schedule and not just streamining Final Fantasy games. I mean the first two streams were still kinda Final Fantasy-themed including a really fun art stream drawing some of my friends and kittens in Final Fantasy III/V jobs. It was a lot of fun! I also got passed the demon wall in IV and am actually nearing the end game now! I think I&amp;#39;ll try to beat it this week!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
You may notice that this is coming out late and, if you&amp;#39;re really observant it was created &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the stream recap for this week. I had originally been trying to get the recaps out on Thursday, but this meant some weirdness in what was covered in the recaps and what was scheduled because a Thursday release meant I would work on them on Wednesday, in the middle of the week, and my schedule was (and still is) written for Monday through Sunday. I moved the release to Friday, but that still doesn&amp;#39;t really work, so I&amp;#39;m making another change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>The second week of a three week Final Fantasy Special! Haven&amp;#39;t made it passed Final Fantasy III. Had to do a lot of short streams and it is really kicking my behind. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll finally beat the cloud of darkness tomorrow!</description>

        <description>This week begins the first of three special weeks! A fellow streamer had decided to do a final fantasy month and I decided to join in…sort of. I already did the schedule for the first week of July, so I&amp;#39;m only doing the last three weeks, but its still a special three weeks of Final Fantasy!</description>

        <description>It was finally time for a new card for OBS. After turning off my model too many times so I can take a break, I decided, I needed a BRB card 😝 I also went back to Hello Kitty Island Adventure and Persona!</description>

        <description>A fun mixed-bag of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I work on various art assets, like stream overlays, frames, cards, and my vTubing model, I have settled on a kind of brand for myself that revolves around a few colors. While I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this site, its design, and the various color schemes available for it, I wonder if it will serve this kind of &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; that I am building for myself on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi&#34;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m thinking it would be best to make this site an extension of the brand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/stream-recap-week-1/&#34;&gt;Stream Recap&lt;/a&gt; for this week you won&amp;#39;t find a Persona 3 stream, but I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have one. It was a surprise stream and you can catch it on my Twitch page. I&amp;#39;ll also be in next week&amp;#39;s recap, probably. Anyway, I also worked a bit on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p3reload/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 3 Reload Walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The Stream Recap!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it my link! I have decided how I will handle news and stream schedules! There will be essentially &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; tags &amp;#34;news&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;recap&amp;#34; but you don&amp;#39;t have to know that unless you&amp;#39;re looking specifically for streaming news versus regular news. You can also just look at the tag &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; for everything to do with streams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Art Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/am-a-streamer-now/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. I guess the only way to know is to see how I am with more viewers 😅 I still had fun though. You&amp;#39;ll be able to catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>If you&amp;#39;ve been around my site for awhile than you probably know that I am an artist and a writer. Well, I haven&amp;#39;t really been doing much writing of late, other than school papers, but I&amp;#39;m still a writer, okay? Well, anyway, I have a new hat! A streamer hat!</description>

I know &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/case-of-the-mehs/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; new article sounded a little bleak and I even told you not to expect weekly updates any more, but, well here I am! I wanted to give myself a bit of an &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; because of how I was feeling. I&amp;#39;m still not feeling great, but I&amp;#39;m here and I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; working on updates. Unfortunately, the one you will see will look like a removal of something and not updating or adding anything. Don&amp;#39;t worry, it will be back later and in greater numbers 😆&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Working on my Persona guides, especially the Persona 4 Golden &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/slink/&#34;&gt;Social Link guides&lt;/a&gt; and working on my own professional development at the same time has got me thinking a little bit about the subject of building Social Networks. I&amp;#39;m not talking about Facebook, or Twitter, or even Mastodon, I&amp;#39;m talking about the relationships we build with each other over time much like the protagonists in a Persona game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Progress!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into that topic though I just wanted to let everyone know that I am making progress on transcribing my DnD adventures into &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/keyrie/&#34;&gt;Keyrie&amp;#39;s Journal&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn&amp;#39;t really aware of how much we actually manage to do per session even if it seems like the sessions just fly by 😅 So this is a bit more of an undertaking than I originally thought it would be. I think it&amp;#39;ll be worth it in the end even if I still only have the first chapter available right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Okay maybe that&amp;#39;s not really that fair of a question, especially considering spring break literally just started, but, hey, it&amp;#39;s already Thursday! I mean come on I only get three weeks so what&amp;#39;s up with that!? I always come up with all sorts of things that I want to do accomplish during my breaks. Things that I don&amp;#39;t think I would have time to work on while I&amp;#39;m in class. However, its already Thursday of the first week and I haven&amp;#39;t really made much of a dent. That said, there are still quite a few things I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; worked on this week!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, this was going to be a totally different and probably much shorter post, but then things happened. First, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; put the rant tag on just in case but I don&amp;#39;t really think this is going to be much of rant. Second I&amp;#39;m actually going to be mostly focusing on some new wellness things I&amp;#39;m doing to keep myself from going crazy and not so much on what happened with Hugo. That, however, will be the first little header here so if you want to skip it, you can just go to the next header listed in the &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s on this page&amp;#34; list to the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have 10 max S-Links in Persona 4 Golden \ ( ^ o ^ ) / Just had to say it, lol. That should give you an indication that I have started playing it again. which I have. I&amp;#39;m mostly just working on my S-Links and trying to get through some of the extra post-game content while I wait for things to pick up again. You would think I&amp;#39;d be used to this kind of thing knowing that I also like visual novels, but, for some reason this sort of thing is just not so fun in Persona. Its a big part of it and part of the appeal for some, I suppose, but, in this quantity not so fun. Actually Persona got me thinking about something else lately. So I guess it&amp;#39;s time for another Yaya rant 😅 Feel free to skip the first heading if you just want the site updates. Though I promise this rant will be less angry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am committed to making sure there is something new on this site every week even if there isn&amp;#39;t much! There will probably be some things coming up next week, but this week was quite a bit busier than it appeared on screen, particularly today. I still have a few things to finish, but at least work is over 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Only a News Article?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have to apologize, I had a lot to do this week for work and school and those are all just a bit more important than this site. I did &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; a few things that will hopefully make it up next week, but they are not in a completed state so you won&amp;#39;t see them this week. There is this article though so at least I have something. At least I can be here to tell you what happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Persona 4 Golden is Over... Maybe?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
It seems I have completed the last main dungeon for Persona 4 Golden. I&amp;#39;m planning on bringing my walkthrough up to that point today or tomorrow. Now, there is still the matter of, what I believe is, the Golden content. This is the part about finding Marie that, if memory serves (as I don&amp;#39;t think she was even in the original) was added for the Golden re-release. So I still have content to work through, but its almost there. Also, I would like to point out that I have a reference generated for a new personal project and I plan on starting that tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information. Things like when Marie will be available and other commentary will be moved to other sections, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/slink/&#34;&gt;Social Links&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/quests/&#34;&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;. As for other news, I have finished a game! Look forward to a new review and many more in 2024!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is the first time I&amp;#39;m late since starting my weekly updates. It has been a crazy day! Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not too late, but I had a lot of work to do and a lot of other plans. Also I may have spent too long trying to get notes off my Steam Deck so I could update the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; and not enough time actually updating the website 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Looking Back
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in 2023. I quit working as Behavior Technician to focus more on my school work, I completed the first (of many) dissertation milestones, and I became a Graduate Assistant and a commissioned artist. Becoming a commissioned artist renewed my love of art and drawing and I have produced more pictures this year than I have in any year for the past few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to. I actually had a total of three Christmas projects, but none will be leaked here early, I can guarantee that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something 😅 The thing was…this site 😆 Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities. It would be different if I had an idea for something like a new episode of RE[BASE] and was postponing that, but I just got an idea for another episode for Nagisa&amp;#39;s story today, so not really behind yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there&amp;#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut 😉) next week. Plus a few more announcements I&amp;#39;m working on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics. I also hope to add more VNs that I have on my Steam wishlist to the reviews. I&amp;#39;m still working on finishing Persona 4 Golden, but I focused more on getting homework done this week so I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall behind during the holiday. I will be putting up the commissions I finished last week though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun…as long as you ignore the last heading that is 😜&lt;/p&gt;

New Position
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology. Previously I was working as an ABA therapist. This work was fun, but it was also beginning to be too much. I was having difficulty focusing on my client&amp;#39;s needs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my schoolwork. So, I decided to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hello everypeep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in 😆 Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!?&amp;#34; and get all depressed, so I won&amp;#39;t do that. I&amp;#39;ll just continue to be happy that I make an effort every week to at least post a news article!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/commissions/&#34;&gt;about commissions&lt;/a&gt; page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
I want commissions!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I get paid so win-win maybe. Anyway, I know I mentioned them a little bit in the last news article, but I felt that I didn&amp;#39;t really give them enough attention, so I added a dedicated page that talks about them in a bit more detail. This includes things I feel I&amp;#39;m good at and am more than willing to draw for you as well as things I absolutely won&amp;#39;t draw. I also go into more detail on how to get a hold of me and how payments are likely to work. This was only one addition though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello and welcome to another update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve. This week, there is no new review, but I plan on writing one for Little Witch Nobeta fairly soon as I just completed that game. I didn&amp;#39;t do everything, but I did finish the main story so I feel qualified to review it now. You can look forward to that review in next week&amp;#39;s update!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
So I wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; wrong! I did say that before you read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022/where-are-the-halloween-towns/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt; that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Maze of Madness
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta. There are also events! Now, you can read the full list on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/news/patch_notes-173&#34;&gt;gamigo&amp;#39;s news page&lt;/a&gt;, but my favorite is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness. This is where you have to navigate your way through a maze while avoiding a certain monster, if they hit you, your out and you have to start the maze all over again. As I said, it can be very frustrating, but it can also be very fun! Last year I loved to run through the maze with friends. Unfortunately they&amp;#39;ve mostly moved on to other games, but a few still run around with me, and that&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiesta.gamigo.com&#34;&gt;Fiesta Online&lt;/a&gt; during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October. However, it is now almost Halloween proper, just 11 days of the day I&amp;#39;m writing this, and still no sign of my spook-tacular towns 🥲&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Japanese Translation</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven&amp;#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I&amp;#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it 😅 I haven&amp;#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hello everypeep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform. First, I guess I little background information is in order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
