        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of some of my favorite wallpapers. I like vector art and I like wallpapers that aren&amp;rsquo;t too busy. If you like those things too, then maybe you should download &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of these&amp;hellip;or not&amp;hellip;up to you 😜.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; own &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these wallpapers. If I have information on who created it, that information is in the caption! Also for basically all of autumn last year I rocked a very dark theme on all of my devices. This was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://draculatheme.com&#34;&gt;Dracrula Theme&lt;/a&gt; it was a really cool theme and the macOS wallpaper (there are other versions, check out the site!) for it is included below!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh boi! I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to do with this one. The original plan was to have screenshots of the ADVENTURES I&amp;rsquo;ve had in past games, but, with clips on Twitch and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFe_D6-Ml99oIIwXaAMrMayxFG7lDdSE&#34;&gt;YouTube Archives&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure any more. I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated it in &lt;strong&gt;ages&lt;/strong&gt; 😅 Right now its just a random set of screenshots from one MMO I used to play. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll showcase ADVENTURES I have with kittens? I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, thanks for looking though 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on. However, the group did encounter someone in Sea of Greed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
