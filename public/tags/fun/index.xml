        <description>This is a collection of some of my favorite wallpapers. I like vector art and I like wallpapers that aren&amp;rsquo;t too busy. If you like those things too, then maybe you should download some of these&amp;hellip;or not&amp;hellip;up to you 😜.
I do not own any of these wallpapers. If I have information on who created it, that information is in the caption! Also for basically all of autumn last year I rocked a very dark theme on all of my devices.</description>

        <description>I draw too! That&amp;rsquo;s right I don&amp;rsquo;t just play games, but I also like to draw. I don&amp;rsquo;t get much time to draw, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make some more time soon. I have ideas I want to do! Anyway, below are just a couple of things that I have drawn!</description>

        <description>This is my Wall o&amp;rsquo; ADVENTURE! Currently its a bunch of random screenshots from Fiesta Online. In the future I plan on putting other screenshots from other games that don&amp;rsquo;t fit with a particular theme or story here. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll have more specific galleries for screenshots and peektures that have some kind of theme, but these are all I have at the moment.</description>

        <description>While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself.</description>
