        <description>Two art streams are going the norm for awhile, methinks. Also, due to Thanksgiving in the US, I only had two game streams. Two and two!</description>

        <description>I had my first collabrative stream ever! It was a lot of fun! I hope for more of these in the future, especially with the awesome Bsparkx! In other news, there was also two art streams, and there probably will be for near future!</description>

        <description>After banishing Ghost Cat for the year, I have returned to a more normal lineup of wonderful games. Well, so far I really just did some announcements and played Final Fantasy V, but it was a nice change of pace. I hope everyone enjoyed Spooky Month!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last week I &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/announcing-announcement/&#34;&gt;announced some announcements&lt;/a&gt;, well it is finally time to actually make those announcements. Technically, I already made them they were in a stream that is available on the YouTube channel, but I thought I should also right them out here and in the Discord. Though I already wrote them out in the Discord. It&amp;#39;s much easier to post things quickly there, which I may have also mentioned last week. Anyway what I announced was:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>Sick week of sickness was not fun, not fun at all. Two of my streams were canceled this week due to illness. Still, I did manage to finish the rat game, and two canceled means three went up, so that&amp;#39;s good, right?</description>

        <description>Worked on a couple of new emotes and had a lot of fun with spooky games, except Corpose Party. Let&amp;#39;s just say, I&amp;#39;m glad I decided not to play it during the night 😅</description>

        <description>Not only did I create a few fairy wings and a head pat emote this week, but this was also the official debut of ghost cat! What are her intentions with my stream? Who even is she? I guess we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and find out!</description>

        <description>I needed two art streams to do one project this week! Well, maybe only one and half, but I made it two. I also streamed a bit more on YouTube this week, and I messed around with on screen chat there. Next week will be more on Twitch, cuz I&amp;#39;m affiliate!</description>

        <description>This is just a short notice! Last week, I did a test stream on YouTube. While the game itself didn&amp;#39;t cooperate, the stream worked very well. In fact I enjoyed it! I think my flow just works better with YouTube. I don&amp;#39;t plan on leaving Twitch anytime soon, but I&amp;#39;ll be doing exclusive streams on both YouTube and Twitch.</description>

        <description>Mostly a normal week this week. Did a fun Maker Monday stream with elemental-themed icons and played a lot of fun games. You will not see Final Fantasy here…I had to cancel that stream.</description>

        <description>Tried another day with two streams. Worked out a bit better! Well, probably because I had a holiday, but still. Really fun week that even included finishing Pokemon Sword!</description>

        <description>Shorter week because of a carpet install. Everything is looking great though and I&amp;#39;m loving my new room. I managed an art stream before the install and a few game streams after! Still a pretty nice week.</description>

        <description>Another two art streams in one week, but only one stream per day. The week was definitely not as hectic as the last week. We went back to Hollow Knight and Xenosaga, but started the next the Final Fantasy game!</description>

        <description>Did a new thing by splitting Saturday with a game stream in the afternoon and an art stream at night. Was a little hectic and probably not worth it so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll do something like that again unless I have a special event. Also I beat Final Fantasy IV!</description>

        <description>A week of new things! Started the week making a new frame for art streams and a new pngtuber for them too. Off stream I created a new game stream frame which debuted during a Persona stream and I even played a new game (well new for the channel)!</description>

        <description>Back to a regular stream schedule and not just streamining Final Fantasy games. I mean the first two streams were still kinda Final Fantasy-themed including a really fun art stream drawing some of my friends and kittens in Final Fantasy III/V jobs. It was a lot of fun! I also got passed the demon wall in IV and am actually nearing the end game now! I think I&amp;#39;ll try to beat it this week!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
You may notice that this is coming out late and, if you&amp;#39;re really observant it was created &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the stream recap for this week. I had originally been trying to get the recaps out on Thursday, but this meant some weirdness in what was covered in the recaps and what was scheduled because a Thursday release meant I would work on them on Wednesday, in the middle of the week, and my schedule was (and still is) written for Monday through Sunday. I moved the release to Friday, but that still doesn&amp;#39;t really work, so I&amp;#39;m making another change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>The second week of a three week Final Fantasy Special! Haven&amp;#39;t made it passed Final Fantasy III. Had to do a lot of short streams and it is really kicking my behind. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll finally beat the cloud of darkness tomorrow!</description>

        <description>This week begins the first of three special weeks! A fellow streamer had decided to do a final fantasy month and I decided to join in…sort of. I already did the schedule for the first week of July, so I&amp;#39;m only doing the last three weeks, but its still a special three weeks of Final Fantasy!</description>

        <description>It was finally time for a new card for OBS. After turning off my model too many times so I can take a break, I decided, I needed a BRB card 😝 I also went back to Hello Kitty Island Adventure and Persona!</description>

        <description>A fun mixed-bag of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

        <description>&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Art Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/am-a-streamer-now/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. I guess the only way to know is to see how I am with more viewers 😅 I still had fun though. You&amp;#39;ll be able to catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
