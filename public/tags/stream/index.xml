        <description>Another shorter week, but a lot happened. We found the next treasure in Persona 5 Royal (though our route isn&amp;#39;t secure yet). We got through Labyrinthos in Xenosaga Episode II. We even managed not only a few main story quests in Wuthering Waves, but also a couple event quests! Busy busy week!</description>

        <description>A pretty normal week. Hope every kitten is getting used to the new routine. We had a great art stream working on new panels for page six of my comic. We also found a new target in Persona 5 Royal and made it to Laborythos in Xenosaga Episode II. My favorite though was probably our Genshin stream where I got to trail Nahida.</description>

        <description>Pretty normal week. I went down to four streams this week and I think that went pretty well. I technically have two days set aside for collabs, but decided for this week (and next) to just leave those days open. Still had great fun with Wuthering Waves, Persona 5 Royal, and Xenosaga. Also Page 6 let&amp;#39;s go!</description>

        <description>Overall a good week this week! I didn&amp;#39;t get back to my comic just yet, but I did create a new PNGTuber for when I stream things on the Mac and it can&amp;#39;t handle everything (looking at you Wuthering Waves). I also got back to Persona 5 Royal, where we discovered it is possible to change someone&amp;#39;s heart. I ended the week by finally rescuing Nahida!</description>

        <description>No art stream this week, but we did reveal a new outfit! Other than that, it was a good week of game streams. We found out that Aneeta Job doesn&amp;#39;t need that same job, and we got her something new to do. We also had some fun with event quests in Wuthering Waves, and even finished the castle in Persona 5 Royal. See, not a bad week!</description>

        <description>Lots of fun this week! I did a really fun April Fool&amp;#39;s prank on Tuesday and had a much better Wuthering Waves stream on Wednesday. We made more progress in Xenosaga Episode 2, and even nepped a lot of neps on Friday! Great times!</description>

        <description>A typical art stream and a wonderful collab with Bsparkx playing Wuthering Waves. Well it would have been wonderful if my frames didn&amp;#39;t drop so hard. We made it through and we even managed to start Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters this week!</description>

        <description>New week, new collab! Tried to get it so everyone could hear my collab partner (Bsparkx), but was still good. Also started Persona 5. I was reminded how much I like that game and am very excited to share it with the Kittens!</description>

        <description>Well, the scary uncertainty of last week is all over and done with and we even managed a fairly normal stream week even without a schedule. We had an art stream and even went back to Xenosaga and Kirby! Not bad for not knowing if and when I could stream, no?</description>

        <description>A very short week this week. Lots of things happened outside of my life as a streamer. It was all kind of overwhelming. I did manage a good art stream and we finished Persona 3 Reload. That was all though. Also, there&amp;#39;s more bad news, but I&amp;#39;ll leave it out of this summary!</description>

        <description>Took a small break from the comic to do a new outfit for my smol pngtuber! I kinda just wanted something I could do in one stream, and I did ð I also played a new game, Kirby Star Allies, and continued the fun in both Persona 3 Reload and Xenosaga Episode 2. Also, some more Genshin stuff! Was a pretty good week, methinks.</description>

        <description>The experimentâ¦didn&amp;#39;t help. I think maybe I just don&amp;#39;t have enough data points. We did finish quite a few things this week though! Xenosaga Episode 1, Sonic Generations, and the fourth comic page ð Overall, not a bad week. Just need to figure out how to handle Genshin Impactâ¦</description>

        <description>Collab with @Bsparkx went super well! I always end up spending a lot of resin when I play with her, but it is because we have so much fun poking things! I also completed the giant robot in Xenosaga! We&amp;#39;re almost ready for the end. Still trudging along on page 4 of the comic too! Almost done there as well.</description>

        <description>This was supposed to be a typical four game streams and one art stream week, but guess what? Things took an exciting turn! We got an extra Genshin stream! I was so excited because I needed it to finish Lantern Rite quests, and Iâm happy to say I did it!</description>

        <description>A complicated week! Rather than two art streams, I did two Genshin streams, but I ended up canceling my Throwback Thursday ð Still managed to get out of Sumeru City and on to this years Lantern Rite!</description>

        <description>I revealed a new outfit! That&amp;#39;s pretty much the most exciting thing about this week. I mean sure, it was the first week of 2025, but that&amp;#39;s not all that exciting, no? I mean we did play Xenosaga and we did beat Exdeath and finish Final Fantasy V, but that wasn&amp;#39;t that exciting either, right? A new outfit thoughâ¦</description>

        <description>We did some art and we did a bit of gaming. The week was sort because of the holidays. Also a lot of personal thing happened and, well, Portal 2 somehow turned into Genshin here! Still managed to have fun though!</description>

        <description>With the special project done, I returned to my comic! We laid out the third page and started the first panel. I only did the one art stream though so that meant we did both Final Fantasy and Persona this week! I also ended the week with co-op in Portal 2 for the first time!</description>

        <description>Two art streams! I really like being an art streamer! Finished the project though. In other news, games happened. We played Xenosaga, Persona, and Final Fantasy. Classic games for me! Almost done with pretty much all three!</description>

        <description>Two art streams are going the norm for awhile, methinks. Also, due to Thanksgiving in the US, I only had two game streams. Two and two!</description>

        <description>I had my first collabrative stream ever! It was a lot of fun! I hope for more of these in the future, especially with the awesome Bsparkx! In other news, there was also two art streams, and there probably will be for near future!</description>

        <description>After banishing Ghost Cat for the year, I have returned to a more normal lineup of wonderful games. Well, so far I really just did some announcements and played Final Fantasy V, but it was a nice change of pace. I hope everyone enjoyed Spooky Month!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last week I &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/announcing-announcement/&#34;&gt;announced some announcements&lt;/a&gt;, well it is finally time to actually make those announcements. Technically, I already made them they were in a stream that is available on the YouTube channel, but I thought I should also right them out here and in the Discord. Though I already wrote them out in the Discord. It&amp;#39;s much easier to post things quickly there, which I may have also mentioned last week. Anyway what I announced was:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>Sick week of sickness was not fun, not fun at all. Two of my streams were canceled this week due to illness. Still, I did manage to finish the rat game, and two canceled means three went up, so that&amp;#39;s good, right?</description>

        <description>Not only did I create a few fairy wings and a head pat emote this week, but this was also the official debut of ghost cat! What are her intentions with my stream? Who even is she? I guess we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and find out!</description>

I also streamed a bit more on YouTube this week, and I messed around with on screen chat there. Next week will be more on Twitch, cuz I&amp;#39;m affiliate!</description>

        <description>This is just a short notice! Last week, I did a test stream on YouTube. While the game itself didn&amp;#39;t cooperate, the stream worked very well. In fact I enjoyed it! I think my flow just works better with YouTube. I don&amp;#39;t plan on leaving Twitch anytime soon, but I&amp;#39;ll be doing exclusive streams on both YouTube and Twitch.</description>

        <description>Mostly a normal week this week. Did a fun Maker Monday stream with elemental-themed icons and played a lot of fun games. You will not see Final Fantasy hereâ¦I had to cancel that stream.</description>

        <description>Tried another day with two streams. Worked out a bit better! Well, probably because I had a holiday, but still. Really fun week that even included finishing Pokemon Sword!</description>

        <description>Shorter week because of a carpet install. Everything is looking great though and I&amp;#39;m loving my new room. I managed an art stream before the install and a few game streams after! Still a pretty nice week.</description>

        <description>Another two art streams in one week, but only one stream per day. The week was definitely not as hectic as the last week. We went back to Hollow Knight and Xenosaga, but started the next the Final Fantasy game!</description>

        <description>Did a new thing by splitting Saturday with a game stream in the afternoon and an art stream at night. Was a little hectic and probably not worth it so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll do something like that again unless I have a special event. Also I beat Final Fantasy IV!</description>

        <description>A week of new things! Started the week making a new frame for art streams and a new pngtuber for them too. Off stream I created a new game stream frame which debuted during a Persona stream and I even played a new game (well new for the channel)!</description>

        <description>Back to a regular stream schedule and not just streamining Final Fantasy games. I mean the first two streams were still kinda Final Fantasy-themed including a really fun art stream drawing some of my friends and kittens in Final Fantasy III/V jobs. It was a lot of fun! I also got passed the demon wall in IV and am actually nearing the end game now! I think I&amp;#39;ll try to beat it this week!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
You may notice that this is coming out late and, if you&amp;#39;re really observant it was created &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the stream recap for this week. I had originally been trying to get the recaps out on Thursday, but this meant some weirdness in what was covered in the recaps and what was scheduled because a Thursday release meant I would work on them on Wednesday, in the middle of the week, and my schedule was (and still is) written for Monday through Sunday. I moved the release to Friday, but that still doesn&amp;#39;t really work, so I&amp;#39;m making another change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>The second week of a three week Final Fantasy Special! Haven&amp;#39;t made it passed Final Fantasy III. Had to do a lot of short streams and it is really kicking my behind. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll finally beat the cloud of darkness tomorrow!</description>

        <description>This week begins the first of three special weeks! A fellow streamer had decided to do a final fantasy month and I decided to join inâ¦sort of. I already did the schedule for the first week of July, so I&amp;#39;m only doing the last three weeks, but its still a special three weeks of Final Fantasy!</description>

        <description>A fun mixed-bag of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

        <description>&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Art Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/am-a-streamer-now/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. I guess the only way to know is to see how I am with more viewers ð I still had fun though. You&amp;#39;ll be able to catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
