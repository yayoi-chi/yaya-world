        <description>It&amp;#39;s good to be back to regular stream recaps! These are far more manageable than giant four-week recaps. This week we had a good normal week where we started by designing a uniform and a lab coat for Yayai. We also finished Fontaine in Genshin Impact and returned to the farm where we started constructing a coop. Persona saw more exploration of Futaba&amp;#39;s Tomb and we even managed to get into the Wise Owl Forest in Dark Cloud!</description>

        <description>For the past four weeks I had to focus on my comprehensive examinations. I had managed to stream pretty regularly even during the exams, but didn&amp;#39;t update this site much. So, I have a lot to update you on!</description>

        <description>Made more progress on my comic and had a lot of fun in Genshin and Wuthering Waves. Xenosaga too, but that one led to a bit of a headache and some heartbreak and sadness and not because of the story. We worked through it though! I appreciate the patience of my kittens!</description>

        <description>A slightly shorter week this week because of a holiday. We still managed to work on our comic page during Maker Monday and managed an exclusive stream on YouTube. Other than that we finished our bank heist and even got back to the future (sort of). So a good week, methinks!</description>

        <description>Two art stream fun again! We first worked on page 7 of my comic then we played a few games, including Xenosaga and Genshin, then I finished up some wings for sub-badges and worked a bit more on page seven of the comic. Overall it was a fun week delving into timey-whimey and mysterious shtuff. More mysteries soon, but hopefully we will get back to our own time in Xenosaga too! Also, let&amp;#39;s rob a bank, doesn&amp;#39;t that sound fun?</description>

        <description>Art streams are going very well! I really like getting the opportunity to chat while working on random art projects or my comic. I still play games though, because I like playing games too! This week we located some intel in Persona 5, solved more mysteries in Genshin Impact, and uncovered the past in Xenosaga Episode III. I didn&amp;#39;t realize it was such a mystery-filled week! Much fun though, methinks</description>

        <description>Transforming back into mostly an art streamer, slowly. We had an outfit reveal this week, but I also did some random art then and I did some more random art the next day. This left only three days for game streams, but I think that&amp;#39;s okay. I like the art streams and, we did get our paws on Cartethyia!!</description>

        <description>Took a bit of an extra break this week so we only did three game streams. We also began the great experiment to multistream. This started with the art stream and continued for most streams. We streamed Wuthering Waves, Xenosaga Episode III (actual gameplay), and Genshin Impact. Hope every kitten had fun!</description>

        <description>Wow! Our little experiment with Wuthering Waves was a good success! Also, look at that, we made it to Xenosaga Episode III. In terms of story, Episode I is my favorite, but I like how III plays. We also made it to Fontaine. It was a good week!</description>

        <description>Lots of good stuff happened this week. We did two panels so now we just have one left for Page 6. We also finished Xenosage Episode II in one of my longest streams since Ghost Cat&amp;#39;s takeover. We got distracted a couple of time too. Lots of good and fun stuff!</description>

        <description>Back to four game streams this week and (spoiler warning) probably next week too. This week included a fun and exciting collab with Bsparkx in Genshin and a Wuthering Waves stream. We&amp;#39;re also very close to finishing Xenosaga Episode II!</description>

        <description>Another shorter week, but a lot happened. We found the next treasure in Persona 5 Royal (though our route isn&amp;#39;t secure yet). We got through Labyrinthos in Xenosaga Episode II. We even managed not only a few main story quests in Wuthering Waves, but also a couple event quests! Busy busy week!</description>

        <description>A pretty normal week. Hope every kitten is getting used to the new routine. We had a great art stream working on new panels for page six of my comic. We also found a new target in Persona 5 Royal and made it to Laborythos in Xenosaga Episode II. My favorite though was probably our Genshin stream where I got to trail Nahida.</description>

        <description>Pretty normal week. I went down to four streams this week and I think that went pretty well. I technically have two days set aside for collabs, but decided for this week (and next) to just leave those days open. Still had great fun with Wuthering Waves, Persona 5 Royal, and Xenosaga. Also Page 6 let&amp;#39;s go!</description>

        <description>Overall a good week this week! I didn&amp;#39;t get back to my comic just yet, but I did create a new PNGTuber for when I stream things on the Mac and it can&amp;#39;t handle everything (looking at you Wuthering Waves). I also got back to Persona 5 Royal, where we discovered it is possible to change someone&amp;#39;s heart. I ended the week by finally rescuing Nahida!</description>

        <description>No art stream this week, but we did reveal a new outfit! Other than that, it was a good week of game streams. We found out that Aneeta Job doesn&amp;#39;t need that same job, and we got her something new to do. We also had some fun with event quests in Wuthering Waves, and even finished the castle in Persona 5 Royal. See, not a bad week!</description>

        <description>Lots of fun this week! I did a really fun April Fool&amp;#39;s prank on Tuesday and had a much better Wuthering Waves stream on Wednesday. We made more progress in Xenosaga Episode 2, and even nepped a lot of neps on Friday! Great times!</description>

        <description>A typical art stream and a wonderful collab with Bsparkx playing Wuthering Waves. Well it would have been wonderful if my frames didn&amp;#39;t drop so hard. We made it through and we even managed to start Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters this week!</description>

        <description>New week, new collab! Tried to get it so everyone could hear my collab partner (Bsparkx), but was still good. Also started Persona 5. I was reminded how much I like that game and am very excited to share it with the Kittens!</description>

        <description>Well, the scary uncertainty of last week is all over and done with and we even managed a fairly normal stream week even without a schedule. We had an art stream and even went back to Xenosaga and Kirby! Not bad for not knowing if and when I could stream, no?</description>

        <description>A very short week this week. Lots of things happened outside of my life as a streamer. It was all kind of overwhelming. I did manage a good art stream and we finished Persona 3 Reload. That was all though. Also, there&amp;#39;s more bad news, but I&amp;#39;ll leave it out of this summary!</description>

        <description>Took a small break from the comic to do a new outfit for my smol pngtuber! I kinda just wanted something I could do in one stream, and I did ð I also played a new game, Kirby Star Allies, and continued the fun in both Persona 3 Reload and Xenosaga Episode 2. Also, some more Genshin stuff! Was a pretty good week, methinks.</description>

        <description>The experimentâ¦didn&amp;#39;t help. I think maybe I just don&amp;#39;t have enough data points. We did finish quite a few things this week though! Xenosaga Episode 1, Sonic Generations, and the fourth comic page ð Overall, not a bad week. Just need to figure out how to handle Genshin Impactâ¦</description>

        <description>Collab with @Bsparkx went super well! I always end up spending a lot of resin when I play with her, but it is because we have so much fun poking things! I also completed the giant robot in Xenosaga! We&amp;#39;re almost ready for the end. Still trudging along on page 4 of the comic too! Almost done there as well.</description>

        <description>This was supposed to be a typical four game streams and one art stream week, but guess what? Things took an exciting turn! We got an extra Genshin stream! I was so excited because I needed it to finish Lantern Rite quests, and Iâm happy to say I did it!</description>

        <description>A complicated week! Rather than two art streams, I did two Genshin streams, but I ended up canceling my Throwback Thursday ð Still managed to get out of Sumeru City and on to this years Lantern Rite!</description>

        <description>I did a practice thing! You won&amp;#39;t find this practice thing here, or anywhere, you had to be there live! I did it though. You know something you can see though? I started a new comic page! Also I got myself stuck in Genshin ð</description>

        <description>I revealed a new outfit! That&amp;#39;s pretty much the most exciting thing about this week. I mean sure, it was the first week of 2025, but that&amp;#39;s not all that exciting, no? I mean we did play Xenosaga and we did beat Exdeath and finish Final Fantasy V, but that wasn&amp;#39;t that exciting either, right? A new outfit thoughâ¦</description>

        <description>We did some art and we did a bit of gaming. The week was sort because of the holidays. Also a lot of personal thing happened and, well, Portal 2 somehow turned into Genshin here! Still managed to have fun though!</description>

        <description>With the special project done, I returned to my comic! We laid out the third page and started the first panel. I only did the one art stream though so that meant we did both Final Fantasy and Persona this week! I also ended the week with co-op in Portal 2 for the first time!</description>

        <description>Two art streams! I really like being an art streamer! Finished the project though. In other news, games happened. We played Xenosaga, Persona, and Final Fantasy. Classic games for me! Almost done with pretty much all three!</description>

        <description>Well I tried to be responsible by starting my comic project and scheduling an extra homework day. I did try that. I just can&amp;#39;t stay away from my kittensâ¦</description>

        <description>After banishing Ghost Cat for the year, I have returned to a more normal lineup of wonderful games. Well, so far I really just did some announcements and played Final Fantasy V, but it was a nice change of pace. I hope everyone enjoyed Spooky Month!</description>

        <description>Sick week of sickness was not fun, not fun at all. Two of my streams were canceled this week due to illness. Still, I did manage to finish the rat game, and two canceled means three went up, so that&amp;#39;s good, right?</description>

        <description>Not only did I create a few fairy wings and a head pat emote this week, but this was also the official debut of ghost cat! What are her intentions with my stream? Who even is she? I guess we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and find out!</description>

        <description>I needed two art streams to do one project this week! Well, maybe only one and half, but I made it two. I also streamed a bit more on YouTube this week, and I messed around with on screen chat there. Next week will be more on Twitch, cuz I&amp;#39;m affiliate!</description>

        <description>Shorter week because of a carpet install. Everything is looking great though and I&amp;#39;m loving my new room. I managed an art stream before the install and a few game streams after! Still a pretty nice week.</description>

        <description>Another two art streams in one week, but only one stream per day. The week was definitely not as hectic as the last week. We went back to Hollow Knight and Xenosaga, but started the next the Final Fantasy game!</description>

        <description>Did a new thing by splitting Saturday with a game stream in the afternoon and an art stream at night. Was a little hectic and probably not worth it so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll do something like that again unless I have a special event. Also I beat Final Fantasy IV!</description>

        <description>A week of new things! Started the week making a new frame for art streams and a new pngtuber for them too. Off stream I created a new game stream frame which debuted during a Persona stream and I even played a new game (well new for the channel)!</description>

        <description>Back to a regular stream schedule and not just streamining Final Fantasy games. I mean the first two streams were still kinda Final Fantasy-themed including a really fun art stream drawing some of my friends and kittens in Final Fantasy III/V jobs. It was a lot of fun! I also got passed the demon wall in IV and am actually nearing the end game now! I think I&amp;#39;ll try to beat it this week!</description>

        <description>This week begins the first of three special weeks! A fellow streamer had decided to do a final fantasy month and I decided to join inâ¦sort of. I already did the schedule for the first week of July, so I&amp;#39;m only doing the last three weeks, but its still a special three weeks of Final Fantasy!</description>

        <description>A fun mixed-bag of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

Art Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/am-a-streamer-now/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. I guess the only way to know is to see how I am with more viewers ð I still had fun though. You&amp;#39;ll be able to catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
