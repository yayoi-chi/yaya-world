        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

        <description>Art Stream If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in last week&amp;#39;s news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure.</description>
