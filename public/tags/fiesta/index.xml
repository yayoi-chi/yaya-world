So I wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; wrong! I did say that before you read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/news/2022/where-are-the-halloween-towns/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt; that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Maze of Madness
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta. There are also events! Now, you can read the full list on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/news/patch_notes-173&#34;&gt;gamigo&amp;#39;s news page&lt;/a&gt;, but my favorite is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness. This is where you have to navigate your way through a maze while avoiding a certain monster, if they hit you, your out and you have to start the maze all over again. As I said, it can be very frustrating, but it can also be very fun! Last year I loved to run through the maze with friends. Unfortunately they&amp;#39;ve mostly moved on to other games, but a few still run around with me, and that&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiesta.gamigo.com&#34;&gt;Fiesta Online&lt;/a&gt; during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October. However, it is now almost Halloween proper, just 11 days of the day I&amp;#39;m writing this, and still no sign of my spook-tacular towns 🥲&lt;/p&gt;</description>
