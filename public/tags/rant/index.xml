I know &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/case-of-the-mehs/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; new article sounded a little bleak and I even told you not to expect weekly updates any more, but, well here I am! I wanted to give myself a bit of an &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; because of how I was feeling. I&amp;#39;m still not feeling great, but I&amp;#39;m here and I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; working on updates. Unfortunately, the one you will see will look like a removal of something and not updating or adding anything. Don&amp;#39;t worry, it will be back later and in greater numbers ðŸ˜†&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, this was going to be a totally different and probably much shorter post, but then things happened. First, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; put the rant tag on just in case but I don&amp;#39;t really think this is going to be much of rant. Second I&amp;#39;m actually going to be mostly focusing on some new wellness things I&amp;#39;m doing to keep myself from going crazy and not so much on what happened with Hugo. That, however, will be the first little header here so if you want to skip it, you can just go to the next header listed in the &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s on this page&amp;#34; list to the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have 10 max S-Links in Persona 4 Golden \ ( ^ o ^ ) / Just had to say it, lol. That should give you an indication that I have started playing it again. which I have. I&amp;#39;m mostly just working on my S-Links and trying to get through some of the extra post-game content while I wait for things to pick up again. You would think I&amp;#39;d be used to this kind of thing knowing that I also like visual novels, but, for some reason this sort of thing is just not so fun in Persona. Its a big part of it and part of the appeal for some, I suppose, but, in this quantity not so fun. Actually Persona got me thinking about something else lately. So I guess it&amp;#39;s time for another Yaya rant ðŸ˜… Feel free to skip the first heading if you just want the site updates. Though I promise this rant will be less angry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
