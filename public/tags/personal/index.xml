        <description>I know last week&amp;#39;s new article sounded a little bleak and I even told you not to expect weekly updates any more, but, well here I am! I wanted to give myself a bit of an &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; because of how I was feeling. I&amp;#39;m still not feeling great, but I&amp;#39;m here and I am working on updates. Unfortunately, the one you will see will look like a removal of something and not updating or adding anything.</description>

        <description>Working on my Persona guides, especially the Persona 4 Golden Social Link guides and working on my own professional development at the same time has got me thinking a little bit about the subject of building Social Networks. I&amp;#39;m not talking about Facebook, or Twitter, or even Mastodon, I&amp;#39;m talking about the relationships we build with each other over time much like the protagonists in a Persona game.
Progress! Before I go into that topic though I just wanted to let everyone know that I am making progress on transcribing my DnD adventures into Keyrie&amp;#39;s Journal.</description>

        <description>Okay maybe that&amp;#39;s not really that fair of a question, especially considering spring break literally just started, but, hey, it&amp;#39;s already Thursday! I mean come on I only get three weeks so what&amp;#39;s up with that!? I always come up with all sorts of things that I want to do accomplish during my breaks. Things that I don&amp;#39;t think I would have time to work on while I&amp;#39;m in class.</description>

        <description>Well, this was going to be a totally different and probably much shorter post, but then things happened. First, I did put the rant tag on just in case but I don&amp;#39;t really think this is going to be much of rant. Second I&amp;#39;m actually going to be mostly focusing on some new wellness things I&amp;#39;m doing to keep myself from going crazy and not so much on what happened with Hugo.</description>

        <description>This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.</description>

        <description>I am committed to making sure there is something new on this site every week even if there isn&amp;#39;t much! There will probably be some things coming up next week, but this week was quite a bit busier than it appeared on screen, particularly today. I still have a few things to finish, but at least work is over ðŸ˜…
Only a News Article? Yes, I have to apologize, I had a lot to do this week for work and school and those are all just a bit more important than this site.</description>

        <description>I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I could release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to.</description>

        <description>For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!</description>
