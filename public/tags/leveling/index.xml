        <description>The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I&amp;#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr.</description>

        <description>If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.
From this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently.</description>

        <description>If you have followed my guides so far then you&amp;#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.
How best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too.</description>

        <description>After following my guide thus far you&amp;#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you&amp;#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.</description>

        <description>When I first wrote my last guide the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next. Well cap is 140 now so I guess it&amp;#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. Sadly progress is slow and you know longer have any KQs to help you out. So, mayhap, you really don&amp;#39;t want to try, but in case you think capping might be cool, here&amp;#39;s some ideas of what you can do.</description>

        <description>Welcome to my leveling guides to Fiesta Online. This is just a parsed down version of my main guide index. It is mostly here for constancy, but, hey, maybe you want just this list, lol. Also I warning about this guide! This represents the laziest and possibly easiest way to level. By no means is this the most fun or even fastest way. To be honest there are plenty of quests especially for early levels and those are usually the fastest.</description>
