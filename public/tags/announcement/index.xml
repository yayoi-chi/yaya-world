        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>
