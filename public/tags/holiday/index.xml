        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information. Things like when Marie will be available and other commentary will be moved to other sections, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/slink/&#34;&gt;Social Links&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/quests/&#34;&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;. As for other news, I have finished a game! Look forward to a new review and many more in 2024!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics. I also hope to add more VNs that I have on my Steam wishlist to the reviews. I&amp;#39;m still working on finishing Persona 4 Golden, but I focused more on getting homework done this week so I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall behind during the holiday. I will be putting up the commissions I finished last week though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
