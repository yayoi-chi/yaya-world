        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics. I also hope to add more VNs that I have on my Steam wishlist to the reviews. I&amp;#39;m still working on finishing Persona 4 Golden, but I focused more on getting homework done this week so I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall behind during the holiday. I will be putting up the commissions I finished last week though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly funâ€¦as long as you ignore the last heading that is ðŸ˜œ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
New Position
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology. Previously I was working as an ABA therapist. This work was fun, but it was also beginning to be too much. I was having difficulty focusing on my client&amp;#39;s needs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my schoolwork. So, I decided to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
