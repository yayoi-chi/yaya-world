        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something ðŸ˜… The thing wasâ€¦this site ðŸ˜† Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities. It would be different if I had an idea for something like a new episode of RE[BASE] and was postponing that, but I just got an idea for another episode for Nagisa&amp;#39;s story today, so not really behind yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
