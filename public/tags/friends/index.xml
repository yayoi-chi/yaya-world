        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello and welcome to another update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve. This week, there is no new review, but I plan on writing one for Little Witch Nobeta fairly soon as I just completed that game. I didn&amp;#39;t do everything, but I did finish the main story so I feel qualified to review it now. You can look forward to that review in next week&amp;#39;s update!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh boi! I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to do with this one. The original plan was to have screenshots of the ADVENTURES I&amp;rsquo;ve had in past games, but, with clips on Twitch and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFe_D6-Ml99oIIwXaAMrMayxFG7lDdSE&#34;&gt;YouTube Archives&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure any more. I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated it in &lt;strong&gt;ages&lt;/strong&gt; 😅 Right now its just a random set of screenshots from one MMO I used to play. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll showcase ADVENTURES I have with kittens? I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, thanks for looking though 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn&amp;#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on. However, the group did encounter someone in Sea of Greed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
