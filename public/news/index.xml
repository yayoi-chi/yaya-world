        <description>I needed two art streams to do one project this week! Well, maybe only one and half, but I made it two. I also streamed a bit more on YouTube this week, and I messed around with on screen chat there. Next week will be more on Twitch, cuz I&amp;#39;m affiliate!</description>

        <description>This is just a short notice! Last week, I did a test stream on YouTube. While the game itself didn&amp;#39;t cooperate, the stream worked very well. In fact I enjoyed it! I think my flow just works better with YouTube. I don&amp;#39;t plan on leaving Twitch anytime soon, but I&amp;#39;ll be doing exclusive streams on both YouTube and Twitch.</description>

        <description>Mostly a normal week this week. Did a fun Maker Monday stream with elemental-themed icons and played a lot of fun games. You will not see Final Fantasy here…I had to cancel that stream.</description>

        <description>Tried another day with two streams. Worked out a bit better! Well, probably because I had a holiday, but still. Really fun week that even included finishing Pokemon Sword!</description>

        <description>Shorter week because of a carpet install. Everything is looking great though and I&amp;#39;m loving my new room. I managed an art stream before the install and a few game streams after! Still a pretty nice week.</description>

        <description>Another two art streams in one week, but only one stream per day. The week was definitely not as hectic as the last week. We went back to Hollow Knight and Xenosaga, but started the next the Final Fantasy game!</description>

        <description>Did a new thing by splitting Saturday with a game stream in the afternoon and an art stream at night. Was a little hectic and probably not worth it so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll do something like that again unless I have a special event. Also I beat Final Fantasy IV!</description>

        <description>A week of new things! Started the week making a new frame for art streams and a new pngtuber for them too. Off stream I created a new game stream frame which debuted during a Persona stream and I even played a new game (well new for the channel)!</description>

        <description>Back to a regular stream schedule and not just streamining Final Fantasy games. I mean the first two streams were still kinda Final Fantasy-themed including a really fun art stream drawing some of my friends and kittens in Final Fantasy III/V jobs. It was a lot of fun! I also got passed the demon wall in IV and am actually nearing the end game now! I think I&amp;#39;ll try to beat it this week!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
You may notice that this is coming out late and, if you&amp;#39;re really observant it was created &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the stream recap for this week. I had originally been trying to get the recaps out on Thursday, but this meant some weirdness in what was covered in the recaps and what was scheduled because a Thursday release meant I would work on them on Wednesday, in the middle of the week, and my schedule was (and still is) written for Monday through Sunday. I moved the release to Friday, but that still doesn&amp;#39;t really work, so I&amp;#39;m making another change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>The second week of a three week Final Fantasy Special! Haven&amp;#39;t made it passed Final Fantasy III. Had to do a lot of short streams and it is really kicking my behind. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll finally beat the cloud of darkness tomorrow!</description>

        <description>This week begins the first of three special weeks! A fellow streamer had decided to do a final fantasy month and I decided to join in…sort of. I already did the schedule for the first week of July, so I&amp;#39;m only doing the last three weeks, but its still a special three weeks of Final Fantasy!</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve been streaming for two months and haven&amp;#39;t technically had a full debut o:! I do plan on fixing that…just don&amp;#39;t know when. I just worked on finishing my BRB card this week and played some Hollow Knight…I mean LOTS of Hollow Knight 😆</description>

        <description>It was finally time for a new card for OBS. After turning off my model too many times so I can take a break, I decided, I needed a BRB card 😝 I also went back to Hello Kitty Island Adventure and Persona!</description>

        <description>A fun mixed-bag of streams. Started the week with an art stream where I worked on a banner that would eventually also be turned into a new profile picture. Played only four games this week instead of five! Yay for embeds! Went back to FANTASIAN and other faves!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I work on various art assets, like stream overlays, frames, cards, and my vTubing model, I have settled on a kind of brand for myself that revolves around a few colors. While I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this site, its design, and the various color schemes available for it, I wonder if it will serve this kind of &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; that I am building for myself on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/yayoi_chi&#34;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m thinking it would be best to make this site an extension of the brand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>I&amp;#39;ve begun to ramp up my stream schedule just a bit so there are some were a few more streams this week than there had been in the last two weeks. As I mentioned, though, last week had two art streams, but I&amp;#39;ll be putting the second one as the first for this week. Hope that&amp;#39;s not too confusing. We also had a few game streams including my first throwback thursday!</description>

        <description>Quite a lot happened in my second week of streaming. I started the week with two art streams! Also a few things that happened since last week&amp;#39;s recap, were a total of three game streams including a suprise stream testing Persona 3 Reload!</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/stream-recap-week-1/&#34;&gt;Stream Recap&lt;/a&gt; for this week you won&amp;#39;t find a Persona 3 stream, but I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have one. It was a surprise stream and you can catch it on my Twitch page. I&amp;#39;ll also be in next week&amp;#39;s recap, probably. Anyway, I also worked a bit on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p3reload/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 3 Reload Walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The Stream Recap!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it my link! I have decided how I will handle news and stream schedules! There will be essentially &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; tags &amp;#34;news&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;recap&amp;#34; but you don&amp;#39;t have to know that unless you&amp;#39;re looking specifically for streaming news versus regular news. You can also just look at the tag &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; for everything to do with streams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Art Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my first art stream, you can catch it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/am-a-streamer-now/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; news article! This week though, I started simple again by designing a template to use for schedule images and then put it to the test by creating this week&amp;#39;s schedule! I think I&amp;#39;m getting used to making art on stream. Not very many people watch the stream so maybe that has something to do with it, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. I guess the only way to know is to see how I am with more viewers 😅 I still had fun though. You&amp;#39;ll be able to catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>If you&amp;#39;ve been around my site for awhile than you probably know that I am an artist and a writer. Well, I haven&amp;#39;t really been doing much writing of late, other than school papers, but I&amp;#39;m still a writer, okay? Well, anyway, I have a new hat! A streamer hat!</description>

I know &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2024/case-of-the-mehs/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; new article sounded a little bleak and I even told you not to expect weekly updates any more, but, well here I am! I wanted to give myself a bit of an &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; because of how I was feeling. I&amp;#39;m still not feeling great, but I&amp;#39;m here and I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; working on updates. Unfortunately, the one you will see will look like a removal of something and not updating or adding anything. Don&amp;#39;t worry, it will be back later and in greater numbers 😆&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do you ever just have times in your life, or maybe just a day or a few hours, where you just don&amp;#39;t want to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? Like no matter what it is you are doing, even if its something that usually brings you a lot of joy or something you&amp;#39;re normally really passionate about, you just can&amp;#39;t seem to enjoy doing it. I&amp;#39;d honestly like to know if I&amp;#39;m the only one 😅 Well this has happened a few days this week and rather than coming up with something to update the site with, I decided I&amp;#39;d talk about this a little and the struggle with this one is so real for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
After finishing the easiest S-Link guide ever, I have to admit I have not really gone back 😅 I have mostly been playing through Persona3 Reload and P3P. Of course I still have work to do. Fortunately, it seems that the amount of work as decreased a bit since I am more used to the new processes. I also am still working on some stories and ADVENTURES, but most of that work isn&amp;#39;t seen until I&amp;#39;m ready to release it 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think they underworked me last quarter and now this quarter they decided to overwork me 😆 I&amp;#39;m kidding though, but only a little. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a lot more work to do this quarter each work than I did last quarter, but its not a terrible amount. I am hoping it gives me a little bit more hours and more money though. I&amp;#39;ll find this out on my next pay check.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Forgive me for not having much to update this week. We did have a little fun with April Fool&amp;#39;s Day this year and that&amp;#39;s good enough for me, but I need to put out a bit of an update to see if I can clear that and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a few things to talk about so I figured I&amp;#39;d put out a small news article this week and focus on getting my work and shtuff ready for the next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Working on my Persona guides, especially the Persona 4 Golden &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/slink/&#34;&gt;Social Link guides&lt;/a&gt; and working on my own professional development at the same time has got me thinking a little bit about the subject of building Social Networks. I&amp;#39;m not talking about Facebook, or Twitter, or even Mastodon, I&amp;#39;m talking about the relationships we build with each other over time much like the protagonists in a Persona game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Progress!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into that topic though I just wanted to let everyone know that I am making progress on transcribing my DnD adventures into &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/keyrie/&#34;&gt;Keyrie&amp;#39;s Journal&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn&amp;#39;t really aware of how much we actually manage to do per session even if it seems like the sessions just fly by 😅 So this is a bit more of an undertaking than I originally thought it would be. I think it&amp;#39;ll be worth it in the end even if I still only have the first chapter available right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Okay maybe that&amp;#39;s not really that fair of a question, especially considering spring break literally just started, but, hey, it&amp;#39;s already Thursday! I mean come on I only get three weeks so what&amp;#39;s up with that!? I always come up with all sorts of things that I want to do accomplish during my breaks. Things that I don&amp;#39;t think I would have time to work on while I&amp;#39;m in class. However, its already Thursday of the first week and I haven&amp;#39;t really made much of a dent. That said, there are still quite a few things I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; worked on this week!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, I had finished the main story of Persona 4 Golden. I have even managed to get the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; down a bit and I think it fits okay in on part now, so I went and removed the second part. I also have started some work on the other guide sections. Mostly just got Marie up. So yeah I feel accomplished! After finishing P4G, I started P3P, but, before I even started writing this, I managed to get my hands on P3 Reload! So I went ahead and started that too!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Its almost official. I am just about done with Persona 4 Golden. The walkthrough is up to the point just passed the Golden dungeon and that is the last dungeon I will be including in the walkthrough. I hear tales of a hidden dungeon, but I will not be testing those tales just yet nor will that be included in the walkthrough. So basically, the walkthrough is done. There is maybe a day or so left and that will be uploaded next week, but this begs the question of what is happening next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
No, this isn&amp;#39;t a call for you to commission me more, though I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind if I got more commissions. I just wanted a funny title for this week&amp;#39;s news article and I do you have another commission done so, yeah let&amp;#39;s just have some fun! Of course you can still give me more &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/commissions/&#34;&gt;commissions&lt;/a&gt; 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I do love snacks! I usually have nuts, or pocky, or Swedish Fish, or even Skittles Gummies to snack on throughout the day. Snack list day is my favorite day. It&amp;#39;s where I go and take inventory of my snacks, make a list of what I need, then go and buy them. I&amp;#39;m a sucker for snacks, but that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, this was going to be a totally different and probably much shorter post, but then things happened. First, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; put the rant tag on just in case but I don&amp;#39;t really think this is going to be much of rant. Second I&amp;#39;m actually going to be mostly focusing on some new wellness things I&amp;#39;m doing to keep myself from going crazy and not so much on what happened with Hugo. That, however, will be the first little header here so if you want to skip it, you can just go to the next header listed in the &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s on this page&amp;#34; list to the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;#39;m sure you all remember this Little elf right? You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; even remember that I teased a new little section for my adventures. Well its here and its all thanks to a new D&amp;amp;D campaign I&amp;#39;ve entered! I typically play D&amp;amp;D on Saturday nights and I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying it so far. It is just a little extra thing for me to do to keep myself connected socially because I&amp;#39;m not one who really like going out 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have 10 max S-Links in Persona 4 Golden \ ( ^ o ^ ) / Just had to say it, lol. That should give you an indication that I have started playing it again. which I have. I&amp;#39;m mostly just working on my S-Links and trying to get through some of the extra post-game content while I wait for things to pick up again. You would think I&amp;#39;d be used to this kind of thing knowing that I also like visual novels, but, for some reason this sort of thing is just not so fun in Persona. Its a big part of it and part of the appeal for some, I suppose, but, in this quantity not so fun. Actually Persona got me thinking about something else lately. So I guess it&amp;#39;s time for another Yaya rant 😅 Feel free to skip the first heading if you just want the site updates. Though I promise this rant will be less angry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yep just a little update this week, but at least I have some actual new content. It has been awhile since I updated any of my stories, but hopefully I&amp;#39;ll get something up soon. With all that has been going on, I really haven&amp;#39;t been in the mood for writing. In fact, if Keyrie wasn&amp;#39;t something I had already started and nearly finished I wouldn&amp;#39;t have finished that either. I do have another project I had started, but haven&amp;#39;t worked on because I haven&amp;#39;t felt like working on it much either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is going to be a bit of a rant. If that is not why you&amp;#39;re here and not the type of content you want to see from me, I fully understand. Please feel free to skip this article, even if it is still the only update this week. Before you do that though, I&amp;#39;ll let you know a little about what happened and why this is, yet again, the only thing updated this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am committed to making sure there is something new on this site every week even if there isn&amp;#39;t much! There will probably be some things coming up next week, but this week was quite a bit busier than it appeared on screen, particularly today. I still have a few things to finish, but at least work is over 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Only a News Article?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have to apologize, I had a lot to do this week for work and school and those are all just a bit more important than this site. I did &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; a few things that will hopefully make it up next week, but they are not in a completed state so you won&amp;#39;t see them this week. There is this article though so at least I have something. At least I can be here to tell you what happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
It seems I have completed the last main dungeon for Persona 4 Golden. I&amp;#39;m planning on bringing my walkthrough up to that point today or tomorrow. Now, there is still the matter of, what I believe is, the Golden content. This is the part about finding Marie that, if memory serves (as I don&amp;#39;t think she was even in the original) was added for the Golden re-release. So I still have content to work through, but its almost there. Also, I would like to point out that I have a reference generated for a new personal project and I plan on starting that tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to 2024! Let&amp;#39;s kick off the old and ring in the new! In this first week of 2024 I have made more progress on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;. I think I am finally nearing the end of the game! Once the walkthrough is up to the last dungeon and boss it won&amp;#39;t quite be done, I will be cutting some things out and streamlining it (maybe it&amp;#39;ll fit on one page again) so it only helps you get through the game and doesn&amp;#39;t have other information. Things like when Marie will be available and other commentary will be moved to other sections, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/slink/&#34;&gt;Social Links&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/quests/&#34;&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;. As for other news, I have finished a game! Look forward to a new review and many more in 2024!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is the first time I&amp;#39;m late since starting my weekly updates. It has been a crazy day! Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not too late, but I had a lot of work to do and a lot of other plans. Also I may have spent too long trying to get notes off my Steam Deck so I could update the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; and not enough time actually updating the website 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Looking Back
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in 2023. I quit working as Behavior Technician to focus more on my school work, I completed the first (of many) dissertation milestones, and I became a Graduate Assistant and a commissioned artist. Becoming a commissioned artist renewed my love of art and drawing and I have produced more pictures this year than I have in any year for the past few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I hope you all are looking forward to Christmas! If not, well maybe I can give you all something to look forward too! This year&amp;#39;s Christmas illustration is finished and it features Nagisa. It will be your first opportunity to see what she looks like, so I hope that&amp;#39;s enough to get you to look forward to Christmas. I mean, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; release her now, but I&amp;#39;m going to wait just so you all have a Christmas present to look forward to. I actually had a total of three Christmas projects, but none will be leaked here early, I can guarantee that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Things were going so smoothly with all my other things that I was bound to almost forget something 😅 The thing was…this site 😆 Yeah there isn&amp;#39;t really any updates this week. I&amp;#39;m trudging along through Persona 4 Golden still, but I have been focusing more on Christmas projects and less on other things as it is, as the title says, almost that time. Now, I don&amp;#39;t really think of myself as behind right now, just on different priorities. It would be different if I had an idea for something like a new episode of RE[BASE] and was postponing that, but I just got an idea for another episode for Nagisa&amp;#39;s story today, so not really behind yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
For the past several months, I have fell behind on a lot of things. My school work was usually just barely on time, and work from my primary job was always submitted right on the deadline, but my commissions were always just a bit later than I&amp;#39;d like and many of my personal projects, including my playthrough of Persona 4 Golden, were all far behind. This week things changed and now I am not only caught up on everything but I&amp;#39;m ahead!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Things are progressing nicely with some of the illustrations for RE[BASE] and there are already five episodes written. Only one illustration is up so far, but I am hard at working making another one. So far all five episodes center around Allana. Obviously, she is not the only character. In fact, through her story, you have been introduced to a few others, but I am here to announce another main character who will debut (there&amp;#39;s a pun in there for anyone reading this after her debut 😉) next week. Plus a few more announcements I&amp;#39;m working on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics. I also hope to add more VNs that I have on my Steam wishlist to the reviews. I&amp;#39;m still working on finishing Persona 4 Golden, but I focused more on getting homework done this week so I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall behind during the holiday. I will be putting up the commissions I finished last week though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This week has been pretty busy. Been working in a new position and attending lots of meetings and training seminars. I got another commission. On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun…as long as you ignore the last heading that is 😜&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
New Position
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology. Previously I was working as an ABA therapist. This work was fun, but it was also beginning to be too much. I was having difficulty focusing on my client&amp;#39;s needs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my schoolwork. So, I decided to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This site now has a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of news articles! I guess one article each week for almost a year will do that. As a result, I made a few changes to how the news section is organized. You probably won&amp;#39;t notice anything, unless you link to an article. Sorry for all the links I just broke 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
What Changed!?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All articles in this section used to just be in the &amp;#39;news&amp;#39; folder with the date as the file name. So, in the old way this article would have just been &lt;code&gt;news/2023-11-09/&lt;/code&gt;. If you look in your URL bar though you should see something like &lt;code&gt;news/2023/new-news/&lt;/code&gt;. This means that, more consistent with other pages on the site, the file name is now based on the title of the article and articles from 2023 are in one folder while articles from 2022 are in another folder. As I said, it won&amp;#39;t effect much as the index page will still basically look the same, but it will effect links, so keep that in mind! Once again, I do apologize for breaking any of those, but this will help keep the site source more organized for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
The month of October, also known as Spooky Month, is over. Halloween was one of my favorite holidays, but I, sadly, didn&amp;#39;t do much this year. I am still sad to see the month go and, I was also reminded, there are only two months left in the year 😲. 2023 has gone by fast, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Obligatory RE[BASE] update
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons I&amp;#39;ll get into a bit later, you will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be seeing a new episode of RE[BASE] this week. Episode 5 will actually be a spooky day episode, but, no worries its not scary and not too late for a spooky day episode. I&amp;#39;m just said I didn&amp;#39;t have the idea until spooky day and I&amp;#39;ve been busy since so I didn&amp;#39;t have much time to write. Now the episode will be about a week late, sorry for that. It&amp;#39;ll be worth the wait though, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just kidding, I discovered those a long time ago 😝 Actually, what&amp;#39;s funny is that some of my favorite JRPGS are also marked as visual novels, at least according to Steam. For &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of them I can actually see that. Like Hyper Dimension Neptunia, or Fairy Fencer. Those do have some RPG elements to them, like building and leveling your characters and exploring dungeons, but most of the story is delivered in the same fashion as a visual novel. In fact, I can kind of even see it with the Persona series since much of that story is delivered in the same fashion. Sure both 4 and 5 also had some full motion scenes too, but those were kind of few. So, I guess I kind of like visual novels, though I am a bit disappointed in how similar say Neptunia and Fairy Fencer play even though the stories are so different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I guess I&amp;#39;ll start with a confession. There will be no episode of RE[BASE] this week. I&amp;#39;d like to point out that I said that I won&amp;#39;t necessarily be trying to maintain the once-a-week pace for episode releases. I also mentioned that releasing the first three episodes on that schedule was more because I was on break and had a lot of time. So, I would like to say its because I started back in classes so I don&amp;#39;t have the time I did when I was on break, but that&amp;#39;s not really true 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Breaks always seem to go by way too fast. I mean I get three weeks between terms, but those same three weeks always seem to go by faster and faster. Fortunately, the first couple weeks of a new term are always fairly light so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry so much right away. This week has been light enough that I&amp;#39;ve been able to do a lot of extra things. I haven&amp;#39;t quite put together a full character sheet for Allana yet, so I don&amp;#39;t really want to show her off, but I have made a lot of progress on her third episode, it should be ready by the time this goes up and I&amp;#39;ve made some more progress in Persona 4, there will be more in the walkthrough when this goes up too!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I am feeling quite lazy, have been for the last few days. To be fair to myself, I have made progress on all of projects and completed many a to-do item, but I really had to force myself to do some of them. I actually finished episode two of RE[BASE] sometime just after I published the first episode so that will be going up this week. I even started episode three, but I didn&amp;#39;t make as much progress as I wanted and I haven&amp;#39;t played the games I wanted to play this week either. I still need to finish my Persona 4 playthrough so I can get the guide done. I&amp;#39;m only halfway through, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hello everypeep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
During my break I decided to do some productive things instead of just playing video games. I mean I do that too, but not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; that 😝 One of those new things is getting back in to creative writing. While this week&amp;#39;s update likely won&amp;#39;t feature it, I have started a new series of short stories. Of course I&amp;#39;m also now about halfway through &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/&#34;&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/a&gt; so I&amp;#39;ve been updating my guide for that finally!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in 😆 Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!?&amp;#34; and get all depressed, so I won&amp;#39;t do that. I&amp;#39;ll just continue to be happy that I make an effort every week to at least post a news article!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Well, as of writing this I am still technically &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; a thing. I started it thought so, yeah…😆 Anyway, aside from writing a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/baby-back2school/&#34;&gt;ADVENTURE&lt;/a&gt;, I also made a few more adjustments to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/&#34;&gt;fiesta leveling guide&lt;/a&gt;. This week though it is mostly about writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
About the adjustments
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides. It seemed like all the guides were kind of just in whatever order they were created or something and that made it a bit difficult for me to find the write guide. They should all be in the right order though. Babies on top all the way to God-like Adventurer&amp;#39;s at the bottom. Of course the level range for each guide is still available in its description so you&amp;#39;ll know which guide to open based on what level your characters are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/commissions/&#34;&gt;about commissions&lt;/a&gt; page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
I want commissions!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I get paid so win-win maybe. Anyway, I know I mentioned them a little bit in the last news article, but I felt that I didn&amp;#39;t really give them enough attention, so I added a dedicated page that talks about them in a bit more detail. This includes things I feel I&amp;#39;m good at and am more than willing to draw for you as well as things I absolutely won&amp;#39;t draw. I also go into more detail on how to get a hold of me and how payments are likely to work. This was only one addition though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

Hello and welcome to another update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve. This week, there is no new review, but I plan on writing one for Little Witch Nobeta fairly soon as I just completed that game. I didn&amp;#39;t do everything, but I did finish the main story so I feel qualified to review it now. You can look forward to that review in next week&amp;#39;s update!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
So I wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; wrong! I did say that before you read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022/where-are-the-halloween-towns/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt; that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Maze of Madness
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta. There are also events! Now, you can read the full list on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/news/patch_notes-173&#34;&gt;gamigo&amp;#39;s news page&lt;/a&gt;, but my favorite is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness. This is where you have to navigate your way through a maze while avoiding a certain monster, if they hit you, your out and you have to start the maze all over again. As I said, it can be very frustrating, but it can also be very fun! Last year I loved to run through the maze with friends. Unfortunately they&amp;#39;ve mostly moved on to other games, but a few still run around with me, and that&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiesta.gamigo.com&#34;&gt;Fiesta Online&lt;/a&gt; during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October. However, it is now almost Halloween proper, just 11 days of the day I&amp;#39;m writing this, and still no sign of my spook-tacular towns 🥲&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Japanese Translation</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven&amp;#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I&amp;#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it 😅 I haven&amp;#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hello everypeep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform. First, I guess I little background information is in order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
