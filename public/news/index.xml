        <description>Spooky month is over, Christmas is not yet here, so that must mean its harvest time and that, at least for those of us living in the United States, means Thanksgiving, also known as Turkey Day. It also means I short work week and lots of time needed to prepare so not much in the way of updates this week. I picked up a new VN that I will like to review as I heard its one of the classics.</description>

On top of everything I&amp;#39;m still working toward my degree as well. So yeah been busy, but its also been mostly fun‚Ä¶as long as you ignore the last heading that is üòú
New Position As many of you should be aware, I am a PhD student looking to become a professor of psychology.</description>

        <description>This site now has a lot of news articles! I guess one article each week for almost a year will do that. As a result, I made a few changes to how the news section is organized. You probably won&amp;#39;t notice anything, unless you link to an article. Sorry for all the links I just broke üòÖ
What Changed!? All articles in this section used to just be in the &amp;#39;news&amp;#39; folder with the date as the file name.</description>

        <description>The month of October, also known as Spooky Month, is over. Halloween was one of my favorite holidays, but I, sadly, didn&amp;#39;t do much this year. I am still sad to see the month go and, I was also reminded, there are only two months left in the year üò≤. 2023 has gone by fast, huh?
Obligatory RE[BASE] update For reasons I&amp;#39;ll get into a bit later, you will not be seeing a new episode of RE[BASE] this week.</description>

        <description>Just kidding, I discovered those a long time ago üòù Actually, what&amp;#39;s funny is that some of my favorite JRPGS are also marked as visual novels, at least according to Steam. For some of them I can actually see that. Like Hyper Dimension Neptunia, or Fairy Fencer. Those do have some RPG elements to them, like building and leveling your characters and exploring dungeons, but most of the story is</description>

        <description>I guess I&amp;#39;ll start with a confession. There will be no episode of RE[BASE] this week. I&amp;#39;d like to point out that I said that I won&amp;#39;t necessarily be trying to maintain the once-a-week pace for episode releases. I also mentioned that releasing the first three episodes on that schedule was more because I was on break and had a lot of time. So, I would like to say its because I started back in classes so I don&amp;#39;t have the time I did when I was on break, but that&amp;#39;s not really true üòÖ</description>

        <description>Breaks always seem to go by way too fast. I mean I get three weeks between terms, but those same three weeks always seem to go by faster and faster. Fortunately, the first couple weeks of a new term are always fairly light so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry so much right away. This week has been light enough that I&amp;#39;ve been able to do a lot of extra things.</description>

        <description>I am feeling quite lazy, have been for the last few days. To be fair to myself, I have made progress on all of projects and completed many a to-do item, but I really had to force myself to do some of them. I actually finished episode two of RE[BASE] sometime just after I published the first episode so that will be going up this week. I even started episode three, but I didn&amp;#39;t make as much progress as I wanted and I haven&amp;#39;t played the games I wanted to play this week either.</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep,
It&amp;#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I&amp;#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I&amp;#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone.</description>

        <description>During my break I decided to do some productive things instead of just playing video games. I mean I do that too, but not just that üòù One of those new things is getting back in to creative writing. While this week&amp;#39;s update likely won&amp;#39;t feature it, I have started a new series of short stories. Of course I&amp;#39;m also now about halfway through Persona 4 Golden so I&amp;#39;ve been updating my guide for that finally!</description>

        <description>Hello!
I come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in üòÜ Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying &amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t I keep it going!</description>

        <description>Well, as of writing this I am still technically writing a thing. I started it thought so, yeah‚Ä¶üòÜ Anyway, aside from writing a new ADVENTURE, I also made a few more adjustments to my fiesta leveling guide. This week though it is mostly about writing!
About the adjustments After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides.</description>

        <description>This was originally going to be called, &amp;#34;More about commission&amp;#34;, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week&amp;#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!
I want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe.</description>

        <description>This week was not as small as last week, but the updates are still few. One thing is that I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have decided to open up commissions! Other than that, and, as far as this site goes, I have also decided not to wait until I have completed No Man&amp;#39;s Sky to write about it. You can consider this my first impressions of the game. As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!</description>

        <description>This week was a small week. I did play a new game, but I&amp;#39;m not to a point where I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn&amp;#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.</description>

        <description>I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don&amp;#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I&amp;#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week&amp;#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I&amp;#39;m doing fairly good!</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome to another update!
I like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I&amp;#39;m trying to achieve.</description>

        <description>So I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely wrong! I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!
Maze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep üëãüèª
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and‚Ä¶.the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep üëãüèª During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga.

        <description>Hello everypeep!
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform.</description>
