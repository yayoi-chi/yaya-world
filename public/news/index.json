[{"content":" Hi hi üëã You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over two years ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I am was completely addicted ü§™ If I\u0026#39;m honest, Fiesta Online isn\u0026#39;t exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I\u0026#39;ve made friends and just can\u0026#39;t seem to leave them. So I keep playing, even if I\u0026#39;m only slowly leveling one character üòÖ\nOver the last year, I learned that I don\u0026#39;t really like playing Fiesta Online much. I\u0026#39;m still on every now and then, but I\u0026#39;d rather spend time on other games. However, I have also been a member of several guildes and picked up a few things from them, including some guides. If you\u0026#39;re looking for some help then check out those guides or just find me in game. I\u0026#39;d still be happy to help üòÅ\nThough Fiesta is the game play most consistently, I am occasionally on other games, including other MMOs. Some MMOs I like are Final Fantasy XIV, Tower of Fantasy, and Ys Online. Chances are, if you run into a character named Yayoi, YayoiChi, Yayoi Chi, or something similar than I\u0026#39;m playing her! MMOs aren\u0026#39;t all I play, I also play other online games like Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, and I\u0026#39;m a big fan of retro games, like Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers, and JRPGS, my favorite of which is the Xenosaga Saga and Persona series. In fact, I love these games so much, I\u0026#39;ve added some guides from them!\nAlso, I make a pretty good friend. If you happen to be on Steam, Mastodon, or Matrix, you can add me. I put links to my profiles on the bottom of the site. You can use these and the e-mail link to get in touch with suggestions or issues with the site as well, though a prefer to hear about page specific problems in their comments, thank you!\n","description":"My name is Yayoi and I playing games. If you wanna learn more this is the page to do it!","id":0,"section":"","tags":["about"],"title":"Introduction","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/introduction/"},{"content":" Over the past year I have been working as a behavior technician. This has been a fun and rewarding opportunity for me, but it has also be very taxing. I have worked long days and then I worked normal days but was also taking classes full time while working on a PhD. This left me with very little time for anything fun. Well, learning was fun, but not the right kind of fun. I was feeling burnt out and the stresses of managing my cases, dealing with things like tantrums, and all the hours worked were starting to get to me in an unhealthy way. Last month I made the decision to leave.\nToo many spinning plates It was certainly not easy to decide to leave my job. I did like the kiddos I was working with, well most of them, and the work was enjoyable, for the most part. I probably would have kept going too if it wasn\u0026#39;t for my grades last term. Reviewing all of my assignments I knew I wasn\u0026#39;t going to get the kinds of grades I wanted. I could spot everything I was doing wrong, but, whether it was lack of focus after an assignment or during the readings, I just couldn\u0026#39;t find a way to fix the mistakes I knew I was making. I had said that, if I went back to school, then that would take priority and nothing should harm that.\nIn fact, I came up with this little analogy. It was like I had two plates spinning on toothpicks. Both started out spinning just fine, but than they started to wobble and I couldn\u0026#39;t fix them without dropping at least one. I could try my hardest to get them both going again, but, at the end of the day, I needed to let one go so the other could spin right. I chose my work. It has fallen, but now I can have the time and energy to get the school plate spinning up right again!\nHobbies and mental health In truth there were probably more than the two plates. Perhaps one for this site, one for my other art and web projects, and maybe even one for video games. Hobbies, and other things that distract us from the grind of work, are required, I think, in maintaining our mental health. We can\u0026#39;t be all about work and school, or work and family, or even work, family, and school. We need to balance those things with \u0026#34;me\u0026#34; time. Time to just do what you really like to do with or without other people involved. This is where our hobbies come in. They provide unstructured time for us to just be us. I think I lost track of that over the last year, and that may be one reason things didn\u0026#39;t go so well at either work or school.\nMaybe not more time, but more quality time In the summary I said, we can\u0026#39;t make more time. This comes from an interaction between a parent and their child (my client). The child does not speak, but is learning sign language. They often make the sign for more followed by the sign for time. This is interpreted as a request for more time with something, a toy or activity. However, sometimes they would make these signs with no context and the parent would be left wondering what the child was requesting. This was a simple lexical error, but it led to the following interaction:\nchild signs more and time\nparent: More time? More time with what?\nchild repeats signs\nparent: More time? I can\u0026#39;t make more time! Time is a finite thing.\nIts true, time is a finite resource, we\u0026#39;re only given so much of it and we can\u0026#39;t just make more. What we can do though is make better use of the time we have. In other words, we can make more quality time or make our time better. This is what I intend to do now!\nLesson learned! So now I will be a bit picky with how I\u0026#39;m spending my time, I will be balancing it better not just between work (if I find another job) and school, but also between hobbies, family, and entertainment. All of these are important! Any future place of employment that would like me to work weekends or evenings will have to understand that is not something I will be doing, I won\u0026#39;t mind if it was something I occasionally had to do, but I will decide when and how often that is, it will not be decided for me. I am done with that part of my life now.\nAs for what the means for this site! Well, I\u0026#39;m hoping I\u0026#39;ll update it more often and add different guides and maybe new art more frequently. I hope you\u0026#39;ll look forward to that!\n","description":"You can't make more time, you can only make the most of the time you have!","id":1,"section":"news","tags":["news","personal","site"],"title":"More time!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-07-09/"},{"content":" I\u0026#39;m hoping this isn\u0026#39;t going to be a very long entry, but we won\u0026#39;t know that until I have written the whole thing üòù. I\u0026#39;m not in a very serious mood, though maybe I should be. On Saturday, 13 May, I was very tired and stayed in bed most of the time. I let my parents know and I was visited with a COVID-19 test. I took the test and I tested positive for COVID in 2023!\nAbout my COVID Case I\u0026#39;ll get this out of the way really quick. If anyone reading this is worried, you don\u0026#39;t have to be. My case is very mild and I have been recovering rather quickly. I am keeping myself isolated and all is well so far. I will be unable to work for the next four days, but this is a procedure from the company due to the nature of my job.\nThe Good Part Believe it or not, this isn\u0026#39;t all bad. I\u0026#39;ve been feeling overworked and burnt out lately. I never have time for self-care and hobbies. This includes updating this website. I have time for this now and I have been playing games and drawing.\nIn fact, I\u0026#39;m hoping to add another picture to my Creations very soon. This one is taking a little long because I was not able to be up very long during the weekend, but I should have time to work on it a bit more soon, though I am working through some needed training and still doing school work as I don\u0026#39;t need to leave for that.\nFor the future Yesterday I started Portal again, I noticed something I haven\u0026#39;t noticed before. Portal is my favorite game and I\u0026#39;m still learning new things. I haven\u0026#39;t decided to, but I might add some Portal achievement guides or walkthroughs. Again, I\u0026#39;m not sure I will want to do this, but at least I warned you if I do decide to. I may also look into other walkthroughs and guides to add while I\u0026#39;m out. I know this isn\u0026#39;t much of a plan yet, but I just wanted to through this in here.\n","description":"COVID-19 is still here and I found out the hard way!","id":2,"section":"news","tags":["news","personal"],"title":"Covid Visit!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-05-15/"},{"content":" After pushing some updates to my Fiesta Guides a little early, I am back with a few small changes that I was not able to quite get done before having to push those updates! The big thing is I had to change my age in my introduction. Yep, it went up by one because yesterday was my birthday!\nBirthday Stuff! I\u0026#39;ll get this out of the way real quick because there are other things I still need to get in this post. I had a great birthday yesterday. I went out for some Italian food with family and otherwise enjoyed the day. I didn\u0026#39;t get much time to play, which is what I would\u0026#39;ve liked to do on my birthday, but I did have plenty of fun. At 39, birthdays mean something totally different than they did at 10 or 12. I may not have got any presents or had a ton of friends over, but I had a good time. That\u0026#39;s all that really matters. Speaking of friends, well, I don\u0026#39;t really have many. Let\u0026#39;s see if we can change that üòâ\nNew addition to the bottom matter of the site! Since I originally deployed this version of the site I was aware I could put icons and links to my social media profiles on the bottom of the site near the footer in the template that I am using. Other than potentially putting my steam profile down there though, I didn\u0026#39;t really see much point in them, so I just put my e-mail in and that was that. Well I changed it!\nRecently, I joined Matrix and I had switched from Twitter to Mastodon a while ago, both of these sites are supported by the template so I figured, why not just put those in there, and why not have my Steam profile in too. So I added those! I am on Matrix most, but any of these options are good if you want to connect with me. We can talk about the site, MMO\u0026#39;s and JRPGS, or whatever. I would like to know people actually read these üòÜ\nFinally updated my introduction The introduction page was out of date in more than one way. Not only was my age out of date, but all the levels of my Fiesta characters also needed updating. I\u0026#39;ve since fixed that. There have also been small updates throughout the site including adding a link in the footer to my forums. Hey! That\u0026#39;s one other way you can reach me!\nLooking forward As I mentioned, I am busy pursuing a PhD and working. I\u0026#39;m hoping that the next year will not only see some progress on this front but also progress with gaming and the site. Also I\u0026#39;d like to draw more. So let\u0026#39;s hope it all comes together in the next year!\n","description":"I had a birthday!","id":3,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Birthday!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-04-06/"},{"content":" First I did want to kind of get this out of the way! I\u0026#39;ve been playing a lot of games on my Steam Deck and I love it. Its a great thing to have when waiting in my car between appointments and shtuff! So far this has only really served to get in the way of finishing both my Made in Abyss and Persona 4 Golden guides because I have been basically hoping all over the place, including some older games üòâ Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll at least get back to Made in Abyss soon. As for what\u0026#39;s actually new, well‚Ä¶ not much.\nYaya, where the heck are the updates? Well, the short of it is I\u0026#39;m busy and bad at time management üòÖ I\u0026#39;ve been doing a little better and I\u0026#39;ve cut some hours at work, actually been having a lot of cancellations, which is actually why I\u0026#39;m writing this now. Aside from that I\u0026#39;ve been scheduling things and tracking time better. Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll be able to squeeze more time in to maintaining this site and maybe finish playing something so I can finish a guide other than my Fiesta guide.\nSo, I heard there\u0026#39;s a new gallery! There is! I\u0026#39;ve been doing these season-based wallpapers ever since I ran the Dracula theme on all of my devices last autumn. I decided I\u0026#39;d gather those and share them on my website. Now I\u0026#39;ve tried to attribute where I could, but I don\u0026#39;t remember where I got these wallpapers, and I did not make them. My e-mail is linked on all pages and you can also write a comment on the page and let me know if you\u0026#39;d rather me not link these images or if you know who to attribute them too. Please understand I did not steal these and do not claim they are mine. If you ask for them to be removed please provide proof of ownership and give me time to remove them. Otherwise enjoy the images!\nHow about so more art? Speaking of images, I am very aware that my Creations Gallery is looking pretty sparse. Amongst the various things I have not had time to do, drawing is just one of them. I\u0026#39;m hoping, with some of the extra time I have this week, that I will be able to add at least one more item to that gallery soon. Problem is‚Ä¶ I have no idea what to draw. I literally have no ideas, but maybe inspiration will spark soon. I\u0026#39;d really like to have some new shtuff to show you!\nAny way, not really a good update, but I hope its good enough. I also hope I will have better updates soon!\n","description":"I added a wallpaper gallery!","id":4,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"New Gallery!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-04-03/"},{"content":"This is a collection of some of my favorite wallpapers.

You see I was working on playing Persona 4 Golden and completing guides for that game kept me updating the site fairly regularly. Unfortunately, my focused unexpectedly shifted to another game. I hadn\u0026#39;t originally wanted to do a guide on this game, but I found that it was taking a lot of my time and some of that is because I am ending up having to restart section and back track a lot. The game I\u0026#39;m referring too is Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness and it is definitely not easy. I like it, but it offers quite a challenge. After getting lost a few times and, as I mentioned, a lot of back tracking and reloading, I decided to start a guide and some maps for the game to make things a little easier. This has led to this new update for the site!

My name is Yayoi and I am a moon whistle who has learned a thing or two about cave raiding. I\u0026#39;m writing down some of the things I\u0026#39;ve learned in hopes that it may help you out (and me üòú) out on your next cave raid! We\u0026#39;ll go over a few general tips here, nothing too specific, because, well, you know everything is limited. Speaking of limited, that this first thing I think you should remember about cave raiding.\nKnow your limits! As a cave raider who have to be mindful of your limits. How long can you run? How far can you climb? (stamina) How long can you survive without food or water (fullness)? How much pain can you endure (HP)? How much can you carry (g)? These are all very important things to keep in mind. As you get used to cave raiding you\u0026#39;re limits will increase, but you have to always be aware of this, because, if you forget you could easily find yourself in a very irredeemable situation.\nKnow your purpose! Because every resource is limited each cave raid should have a purpose, a reason you going down that day. That reason could be just to explore, it could be to complete a specific request, or it could be to get new experience, hunt relics, or gather resources. A specific purpose, however, helps you to limit how far you\u0026#39;ll go and what exactly you should bring with you.\nExploration If you are diving solely to explore The Abyss you have to be the most careful. You don\u0026#39;t want to starve before you can go very far nor do you want to be killed because you found a new creature you don\u0026#39;t have the means to fight. If you decide go down for exploration focus on bringing weapons, ammo, and food. You may want to focus on bringing ingredients for cooking rather than buying and carrying cooked dishes. However, you may need to bring a few big dishes with you depending on how far your initial dive will be.\nBringing ingredients with you as well as plenty of weapons and ammo means you can hunt while you explore. Cooked dishes are heavy, but ingredients for dishes are relatively light (except meat), meaning you can carry more ingredients, but don\u0026#39;t take every ingredient you can buy or carry. Focus on dishes you know you can get some of the ingredients for as you explore. For example, if you are in second layer, you know you can get plenty of eggs and bird meat as well as a lot of various herbs, so focus on bringing things like salt or spices that you can use with these ingredients to cook bird meat and eggs. There are only a few dishes that you can cook just by gathering ingredients in The Abyss, so keep this in mind when exploring.\nFinally, while exploring, only attack things you can cook and avoid attacking or being attacked as much as possible. You\u0026#39;ll bring a lot of weapons and ammo, but you\u0026#39;ll want to save these for things that you can kill to help you survive and not for defense if possible. Also don\u0026#39;t go to far at once. This goes back to knowing your limits. Know how far you can go with the supplies you have and only go about half that far so you have enough supplies to get back to the surface.\nRequests This is similar to exploration in that you will want to focus on weapons and ammo. Depending on how far you have to go to complete a request you may decide to bring less food or focus on pre-cooked dishes rather than ingredients. My one piece of advice for you though, is don\u0026#39;t take on too many requests at once! Focus on one request at a time unless you have requests that are both short and not far from each other.\nIf you come across a request while you are exploring this is where you have to make a potentially difficult decision. Take a look at your current supplies, decide how far you could go, then decide if you should return to the surface before completing the request or try to complete it with the resources you currently have. Some short requests can easily be done while your exploring, but don\u0026#39;t forget your initial purpose and don\u0026#39;t be mindful of what you can do with the supplies you currently have.\nRelic Hunting and Gathering If this is the reason you want to cave raid today, than you\u0026#39;ll want to keep as much room available for gathering or carrying relics as you can. Some advice, however, decide where you want to relic hunt or gather resources and take only the weapons and food that you\u0026#39;ll need to get to that location plus at least one extra weapon to defend yourself if you need to. If you are relic hunting, remember that cooked food is heavy and so are relics, so make sure you balance this well and focus on ingredients. Most things you\u0026#39;ll be gathering are fairly light so you can bring some cooked food with you if you want. If you want to do both at the same time then start by gathering, as these are lighter, and then move on to relic hunting as you use resources and weapons.\nKnow Where Your Going and Where You\u0026#39;ve Been Take this from a cave raider who has gotten lost more than her fair share of times, you\u0026#39;ll always want to know where you are, where you\u0026#39;re going, and where you\u0026#39;ve been. You\u0026#39;ll want to know these things for two reasons, to help you know how far you\u0026#39;ve gone and to know how to get back to the surface once you need to. No one wants to starve because they got lost!\nIts for this reason that I have begun putting together some maps to help you (and me) navigate The Abyss. So far I have mapped out all the various section of the first layer and how to traverse to and from each area. You can use these maps to help you navigate to specific areas and back in the first layer so you don\u0026#39;t get lost, like I have.\nAnother thing to remember is that it is far easier to descend in the abyss than it is to ascend. To put it another way going down is easier than going up. This is not just because climbing is harder than jumping down, but also due to the curse! If you go up too fast you\u0026#39;ll feel its effects and you\u0026#39;ll need to rest and get used to the new depth. I advise that you always take the time to do this when ascending because you don\u0026#39;t want to be blinded by the curse while creatures are near you or lose your lunch!\n","description":"Cave raiding is not an easy profession and there are certainly a few things you'll need to consider when making a dive.

Christmas has come and gone, along with all the winter-y shenanigans that game with it for Fiesta. I got a new lap desk for my computer setup, I went back to school after my winter break and‚Ä¶well some other life shtuff that we don\u0026#39;t need to talk about here ( \u0026gt; . \u0026gt; )\nNew Game! One good thing that happened this last month was the release of a remake of Persona 3 Portable on steam. I had started playing Persona 3 on PlayStation 2 a long time ago, I was really impressed with it, but never got to finish it. I\u0026#39;m looking forward to finishing it now. I will be writing guides for it has a play, just like I\u0026#39;m doing with Persona 4 Golden. Right now there is just an index up, since I\u0026#39;m still playing Persona 4, but I\u0026#39;ll get things going as soon as a start Persona 3.\nReturning to Eorzea One of my Christmas presents from a good friend, was the complete collection for Final Fantasy XIV. I really enjoyed playing this game when I first got the base game. It has a really good story, but I got stopped playing, even though I wasn\u0026#39;t finished with Havensward, when I hit max level because I didn\u0026#39;t want to get too far behind. Now that I have the expansions I\u0026#39;ve started playing again.\nFFXIV Guides? When? All that said I have a confession to make. Originally I wanted this site to focus on guides for MMOs because those could be a bit hard to find. So I started my fiesta guides. I was playing FFXIV for the first time as I wrote these and my plan was to write guides for that game next. Here\u0026#39;s the problem, I\u0026#39;m not sure what I can contribute here. There are plenty of guides already available online for FFXIV as it is a very popular game. For the time being, I won\u0026#39;t be writing guides for FFXIV. This could change in the future, if I can find a way to contribute. in the meantime, enjoy my other guides!\n","description":"I'm still building new guides and making the website bigger","id":9,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","persona","ffxiv"],"title":"Ready for a New Game!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-01-21/"},{"content":" First thing is first! Marry Christmas everyone! This week, Christmas came to Fiesta. Like the Halloween update, this is kind of a major thing that happens every year. I don\u0026#39;t look forward to it quite as much, but it is nice seeing everything in a more winter-like wonderland. There are some new events and stuff and I\u0026#39;ll see about adding them to my event guide, but, for now I have more news to share!\nBuggy Bug! First I need to make a quick announcement! Everyone, please update your bookmarks! The URL of this site may have changed slightly. Please use the https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/ URL for the main site. For some reason the old URL breaks the root navigation link in the navigation bar. This doesn\u0026#39;t appear to affect the Japanese version, but does effect the English version if your using an older URL that has \u0026#34;en/\u0026#34; in it.\nA guide not for Fiesta appears! Lately I\u0026#39;ve been playing some games that aren\u0026#39;t Fiesta. I know, shocking, isn\u0026#39;t it üòù. I mean I did say there were other games that I play and I did get something new to play games on (I\u0026#39;ll talk more about that in a bit), so why not play through some of my Steam backlog? While playing through that I started playing a certain JRPG that I just recently got on Steam after only having it for PS2 before.\nThe fun thing about JRPGs is they, like many RPGs actually, are very complicated and it can be challenging to get through everything without a guide. I like this challenge, but I like writing down things I discover along the way too. So I created a guide for Persona 4 Golden.\nI have split the guides up into sections, but, at the moment, many of these are just placeholders waiting for me to fill them up. You\u0026#39;ll have to bare with me a bit while I go about completing the story, writing my walkthrough, and working on the other sections. Normally I try to avoid the \u0026#34;under construction\u0026#34; signs and stuff that plagued sites in the 90\u0026#39;s, but this time I want you to see how the guides evolve so its not \u0026#34;under construction\u0026#34; its a \u0026#34;work in progress\u0026#34; üòÜ\nSteamy Deck is steamy I had a friend wanting to see my gaming setup, but, you know what, it really wasn\u0026#39;t much to look at. I don\u0026#39;t really like flashy RGB and I don\u0026#39;t have like a nice keyboard or even a monitor. Instead I had a very simple box connected to a TV. In fact, I was a console gamer pretending to be a part of the PC master race, really. You know what though, valve made a machine for people like me.\nYep its the Steam Deck! That\u0026#39;s it right there sitting on top of a PS4 slim üòÜ. It is still connected to a TV, not pictured, but it also rests on a shelf above the box that used to serve as my gaming PC looong ago. Still helps me run some old Windows games, like Fiesta üòâ, but its mostly just a media and file server now.\nI like the Steam Deck so far, but I\u0026#39;ve only played it a little bit. It is very portable and a big lighter feeling than I was expecting when I first pulled it out. It is much larger than my Switch though. Oh, I have played it handheld a few times and it is really nice. The thing is like if a PC was thrown into a room with a Switch and they had a baby, especially with the dock. It is a Bring You Own Controller affair, but it is nice. Also, as you can tell, I\u0026#39;m not wanting for controllers at the moment. Actually, the two in the peekture are just two in a set of three PS4 controllers I have, and the JoyCon, Nintendo Switch Pro Wired Controller, XBox One Controller, Steam Controller, and SF30 Pro aren\u0026#39;t even shown. Yeah, I have a lot üòÖ\n","description":"I'm building new guides and making the website bigger","id":10,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","fiesta"],"title":"Make my website grow!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-12-17/"},{"content":" Welcome!\nThis is designed to help you figure out what to do on each day of Persona 4: Golden! This is designed to give you suggestions and hints, I will not be telling you exactly what to do each and every day, instead I favor giving you the options (read: things you can do) for each day, and giving you the choice of what you can do.\nI\u0026#39;m currently working through my playthrough, and, I\u0026#39;ve started this kind of in the middle of that playthrough. So I don\u0026#39;t have each day laid out just yet. For now I\u0026#39;ll be pulling from things I\u0026#39;ve read and my own memory, but hope to have a better, more organized, walkthrough up in the future. For now, I\u0026#39;ll be picking up at the second dungeon. The good news is, the first dungeon and the story to that point, is pretty straightforward. Nevertheless I will be covering that when I can.\nThe hot and steamy bathhouse! There is something just a little odd and unexpected about Kanji Tatsumi. On the third day after rescuing Yukiko, Kanji appears on the Midnight Channel. The first time the party sees this they aren\u0026#39;t entirely sure who it is, but it becomes clear after the second viewing. Sadly, they cannot confront Kanji before he is kidnaped. He appears once more in a steamy bathhouse, only he seems a little different.\n5/20 - 5/23 Kanji disappears around the 20th of May (5/20). The 20th is a Thursday. Even before he disappears, Dojima-san tells you to keep an eye out for Adachi in Junes. Believe it or not this is a clue, though its not really Adachi your looking for, but I digress.\nYou see, when Kanji disappears, you will head over to the TV world where your shocked to find that Teddy is having difficulty locating Kanji. To help him out, you need to learn more about the delinquent. To do so you need to find the young man you saw him speaking to just before he was kidnaped. Remember how I said Junes was a clue, well this young man can actually be found in Junes, but not every day. In fact, he is only there Tues., Thurs., and Sat. You need to find him, speak with him, then find Kanji\u0026#39;s mom and speak to her, but there\u0026#39;s a bit of a trick to this. She will only appear after you speak to the young man, and never on the same day you speak to him. So you have to time it right.\nAfter speaking to the young man, go about your day, maybe go to work or do whatever you want that day, keep in mind that your friends, and a few others won\u0026#39;t be available yet. On the next day, go to the textile shop. Kanji\u0026#39;s mom should be right outside, if she isn\u0026#39;t, go about your day as you normally would, if she is, speak to her first. Finally, on the next Tues., Thurs., or Sat. Find the young man and speak with him again. He\u0026#39;ll give you the clue you need to hand over to Teddy. You can hop into the TV right away to hand over the clue and gain access to the bathhouse, or wait until it is most convenient. You should have access to your friends and other social links once you have the clue, but I shared it with Teddy right away, so I\u0026#39;m not sure.\n5/24 - 6/3 If you do the above quickly you may have a bit more time. If your slower you may not have as much time. This is the date I started and should be a good amount of time to get this dungeon done and dusted. I\u0026#39;m still on this date.\nThe first two floors are fairly easy. Keep in mind that each floor is generated randomly by the game, just like with the previous dungeon. There will be chests to open and some fairly easy shadows to beat. There is a cutscene where the party gets their first glimpse of Kanji\u0026#39;s shadow, but this all that is of note. On my playthrough on easy I was easily able to reach this floor in one afternoon. As with all dungeons, mind your time and watch your party.\nAfter a few days I came back and got up to floor seven. On this floor you will encounter a sub boss. He isn\u0026#39;t too difficult. I does appear to have an instant kill skill, and my use it against your female party members. Best to have some revival beads on you. He does nullify light-based skills, and I was not able to find a weakness, though darkness wasn\u0026#39;t tested. I\u0026#39;ll put the output of his analysis below\nName Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Light Dark Daring Gigas 24 Strength 928 100 Nul ? 5/25 On this date you will get a cutscene before school introducing you to a new job, the Tutor job. This is a job that you can go to at night, tues., thurs., and sat. it pays very well (10,000 yen per day), but requires high understanding.\nMarie is also available to go out this day.\n5/26 There is a quiz in class today. This is a fairly easy question as long as you are paying attention. If you want to skip the dialog, however, the answer is, \u0026#34;attendance logs\u0026#34;.\n5/28 The mail order show starts. You can order things from the TV in your room. Watch for deals on Sun., Mon., and Tues.\n5/30 There is another lecture on this day, but there is no quiz and it does not affect what is available for you to do this day.\n6/1 Rain sets in today. This is the game\u0026#39;s warning that you will need to hurry and save Kanji. Marie is available this day as well. Also, it is good to remember that some part-time jobs and clubs cannot be done on rainy days.\n6/4 This is it! This is your last day to save Kanji. You have not made much progress in his dungeon by this point it will be a fairly difficult fight. My strategy, however, was to get to the last floor by 6/3 that allowed me to take on these boss\u0026#39;s with full HP/SP. The results of the analysis are below. Keep in mind that these guys appear to target female party members more, have opposing weaknesses, and can block each other\u0026#39;s weaknesses. This makes for a challenging fight even on lower difficulties. The fight is far from impossible especially for a fully rested party.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Kanji ? Emperor ? ? - - Dr - Null Null Tough Guy ? Emperor ? ? Wk Null - Str Null Null Nice Guy ? Emperor ? ? Null Wk - Str Null Null One final note: These bosses can cast poison and rage on the whole party. In my playthrough rage seemed to effect the female party members while males were less effected. Poison appeared to work the opposite. I\u0026#39;ll update this when I have a chance to test it in other playthroughs\n6/5 Kanji returns! You will now have a few cutscenes to go through where the party will welcome Kanji to their group and discuss the case thus far. Congratulations on finishing the bathhouse!\n6/6 A lot is about to happen and yet hardly anything happens. Here\u0026#39;s what I mean. Over the next several days nothing happens on the midnight channel and nothing new happens in the TV world, however, a lot of events and story notes will take place. At the moment the party will just discuss changes to the killer\u0026#39;s MO and other notes about the case to this date.\n6/8 There is a lecture today. There will be a question, the answer to which is \u0026#34;balance beam\u0026#34;. After the lecture you will begin discussing getting a motorcycle license.\n6/9 You\u0026#39;ll get your license today and you are gifted a scooter. You can practice riding it and unlock other areas to travel from doing so.\n6/13 This is the first day of summer, yay?\n6/15 There is a quiz this day too, the answer is \u0026#34;cheerfulness in a group\u0026#34;. You will have a pick up (as in pickup a girl) contest after school today.\n6/16 The girls go shopping to prepare for the school camp out.\n6/17 - 6/18 Camp out day one, it should be noted none of your usual ways of spending time will be available, its all story at cutscenes, just sit back and let the game hold your hands for a bit\n6/20 Rise makes a TV announcement. The party suspects she might be the next victim. There is a quiz this day to, the answer is \u0026#34;Meiji\u0026#34;. There is a special boss in the bathhouse. Things are about to shift, so this may be your last chance to take care of it.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Intolerant Officer ? Emperor ? ? - - Wk ? Null Null Marukyu Striptease Rise Kujikawa is an idol from the small town of Inaba, where the story is taking place. As an idol, Rise has to conform to a certain personality archetype, but is actually quite different from how she appears on TV. As a result, she is struggling with her true self and the \u0026#34;manufactured personality\u0026#34; she has as an idol.\n6/21 - 6/23 After the party begin to suspect that Rise may be the next target, she begins to appear on the Midnight Channel. Unlike before, they will immediately identify her. Like before, they will not be able to save her, so it will be off to the TV for you.\n6/24 Like with Kanji, Teddy has difficulty pinpointing Rise in the TV world even after her program begins on the Midnight Channel. He asks you to go get more information about her. You need to ask around town to find out more about Rise. You can start with either the tofu shop she works at where the old lady tells you about the paparazzo hanging around or you can start at the school where you can speak to a chubby man at Practice Building 2F who tells you a bit more about Rise and also advises you to speak with someone in the media. Either way you will eventually have to speak to both of them. Once you do, you will be advise to look for paparazzi at the flood plain. You won\u0026#39;t find any yet, but the \u0026#34;kind man\u0026#34; there will advise you to look tomorrow.\n6/25 Now you can head back to the flood plain and find the \u0026#34;photographer\u0026#34; (if you don\u0026#39;t want to/can\u0026#39;t do this today, note that the \u0026#34;photographer\u0026#34; is only there Tues., Thurs., and Sat.). Give the man two pieces of info about Rise, basically all options except that she is in town. With this, he gives you enough information that Teddy should be able to pinpoint Rise. Take this information back to the TV to unlock the dungeon.\n6/26 - 7/9 You have a couple of weeks to save Rise from her shadow. Marukyu Striptease, like the previous two dungeons is roughly 10 floors with a final fight on the next floor after that. There are many different types of shadows and they will begin introducing shadows that nullify or even repel certain elemental attacks. Stay on your toes. Keep a full and diverse party. You can decide what role the main character plays, but I kept him as my Lightning, Dark, and Light damage dealer. Also relay on the analysis option to keep everything sraight. You don\u0026#39;t want to accidently use a repelling element. At about 7F you will be met with a sub-boss. This fight shouldn\u0026#39;t be too difficult, but a fresh party would be helpful as it will likely start with stagnant air (to increase suseptibility for ailments) and will attempt to poison your party. Here are its full stats as reported by analysis after scanning for weaknesses and strengths.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Amorous Snake 33 Lovers 1012 148 - - - - Null Null After this fight the floor mazes will start to get a bit more complicated, and you\u0026#39;ll be dealing with some more difficult shadows. Be very careful as one of them will repel dark, if you aren\u0026#39;t careful you could end up instant KOing yourself (leading to an instant game over). After completing ten floors, I suggest leaving and coming back another day so you are well rested for a two part fight.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Rise ? Lovers ? ? - - - - Null Null Shadow Rise has no weaknesses, but is more than capable of taking advantage of your weaknesses. She is able to use any basic elemental attack. I did not see evidence of light or dark attacks. At a certain point in the fight she will begin to analyze you (yeah I didn\u0026#39;t see this coming at all). When this happens you will be unable to hit her. Just keep guarding for a few more turns to trigger dialog and a suprise twist.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Teddie ? Moon ? ? - Dr - - Null Null It is after the twist that the real fight begins. Shadow Rise, was pretty easy actually, now its time for Shadow Teddie! This will be a real fight. Like Shadow Rise, Teddie has no weaknesses. He will also attempt to lower your party\u0026#39;s defenses right away and inflict other ailments. Eventually he will begin charging attacks. At these points, make sure all party members are guarding when the message \u0026#34;Shadow Teddie is charging up\u0026#34; is displayed. You will block the attack fully. Careful though! Shadow Teddie will attempt to inflict dizzy on a party member, or two, before charging up.\n7/4 There is a lecture and a pop quiz today. The answer to the question is \u0026#34;Pascal\u0026#34;\n7/7 Another lecture and quiz this day. The answer to the question is \u0026#34;The Decleration of Independence\u0026#34;\n7/10 So Teddie joins the party in a new capacity and new form (yeah that was also surprising) and our super cute idol Rise will join the party. She replaces Teddie as your analysist, however, so don\u0026#39;t expect her to be fighting alongside you. Your homeroom teacher was murdered last night and his story appears today on the news.\n7/11 You get a new homeroom teacher. Brace yourself for that, by the way, she isn\u0026#39;t exactly any better than your last. Also, brace yourself for a barrage of cutscenes as everyone discusses the case so far.\n","description":"A walkthrough for Persona 4: Golden","id":11,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","walkthrough","p4g","persona","wip"],"title":"Walkthrough","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/"},{"content":"I draw too!

Currently I\u0026#39;m hoping to keep this to one page and just have a few helpful tricks and hints to completing the events. This will be far from a complete guide to everything about the event, but should be enough for you to have looots of good fun!\nMaze of Madness First up is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness! The Maze of Madness comes about around Halloween time each year. Halloween is celebrated in the US on the 31 of October every year and is all about spooky things! It also happens to be one of my favorite holidays because there is nothing quite as fun as spooky shenanigans. Fortunately the maze is pretty spooky, though kind of more in a juvenile since, but I degrees.\nDuring this event, your goal is to pick up little Halloween tickets. These tickets can be used to purchase all sorts of goodies including permanent outfits! Of course, the maze itself is only one way to earn these tickets, but you can get up to three each time you complete the maze. One ticket for completing it and then two for helping to beat the boss that you can get to by talking to an NPC at the maze\u0026#39;s center.\nPictured are the various routes you can take to reach the center of the maze. To get to the Maze you must travel through a portal by the fountain in Elderine (Sir Gourd van Pumpkin also stands near this portal, you can exchange your tickets with him for items!). This will take you to the Maze of Madness world where you will then have to head for another portal directly in front of where you spawn to enter the maze proper. You will spawn in one of three locations, these are numbered on the map. Also pictured are the spawn locations as they appear in the in-game map.\nOther Quests Before heading into the maze, however, it\u0026#39;s a good idea to look around at the small town-like area you spawn into. There are two NPCs here. These NPCs have quests and each quest can help you get even more tickets. Some of these quests are repeatable and some are daily. Unlike most quests the Fiesta Wiki does not list these quests, but they are usually pretty straightforward. Most of them just require you to gather items from either tombstones or pumpkins from patches outside the maze and return them to the NPCs. There is one, however, that I would like to single out.\nPop goes the Pumpkin This is a daily quest that you can acquire from JackO Pumpkin Jr., the NPC nearest the maze sign. This requires you to beat the maze and the boss you can fight after speaking to the NPC at its center, Pumpkin Bill. I single it out both because it is different and because it awards 10 tickets per day! To beat the boss, gather from pumpkins in the area around Bill. These pumpkins allow drop grenades and warheads. Equip these to your skill bar for ease. You cannot damage Bill with your regular attacks and your skills are locked in this world, so you must throw these items at the boss until he falls. It takes about 100 grenades to take him down, if you\u0026#39;re lucky, however, you won\u0026#39;t be alone. Return to the NPC after you kill him to get a body back in your inventory, open this for some goodies and your 10 tickets!\nOther Things to Note There are titles for completing the maze under a certain time or certain conditions. One condition I remember was running it in under two minutes as a pinky (the candies you acquire from body bags and other rewards will randomly transform you into mobs) and completing the maze in under two minutes normally. I\u0026#39;ll update this section as more things come to mind!\nTerry! (Easter egg event) This is a list of where Terry can appear.

I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!\nMaze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta. There are also events! Now, you can read the full list on gamigo\u0026#39;s news page, but my favorite is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness. This is where you have to navigate your way through a maze while avoiding a certain monster, if they hit you, your out and you have to start the maze all over again. As I said, it can be very frustrating, but it can also be very fun! Last year I loved to run through the maze with friends. Unfortunately they\u0026#39;ve mostly moved on to other games, but a few still run around with me, and that\u0026#39;s great.\nA new guide? The maze can be a bit tricky to navigate, but a friend made a good graphic to help so I\u0026#39;ve put together a guide that shows how to get through the maze as well as a few other tips and tricks. Of course I don\u0026#39;t remember everything from last year, and I believe my characters all got the titles already, but I\u0026#39;ll do my best. When I get the guide made I\u0026#39;ll link it here for you.\nGlad I\u0026#39;m wrong! In this guess I\u0026#39;m really happy I was wrong. I was very worried that I wouldn\u0026#39;t get Halloween content this year, but I did and that\u0026#39;s awesome! There is still one problem‚Ä¶.the problem of time. Since I began working I have, naturally, less time for playing games. I managed to squeeze in a little this week, but I\u0026#39;m not sure it will be enough for all the rewards. I suppose I can only hope that I\u0026#39;ll have just as much fun this year as I did last!\n","description":"So, I was wrong üòÖ","id":14,"section":"news","tags":["fiesta","news"],"title":"The halloween towns are here!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-10-27/"},{"content":" Hi hi everypeep üëãüèª\nIs everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and‚Ä¶.the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October. However, it is now almost Halloween proper, just 11 days of the day I\u0026#39;m writing this, and still no sign of my spook-tacular towns ü•≤\nNo news is good news? So, naturally, someone might think, well golly Yayoi you just gotta be patient, after all they haven\u0026#39;t said their not doing Halloween shinanigins, right? I mean sure, that\u0026#39;s true, but it isn\u0026#39;t like they haven\u0026#39;t mentioned Halloween at all. Earlier this week the Fiesta Online team posted this article on their site\u0026#39;s official news section. The mention Jack-O Pumpkin, who has been a staple of events surrounding the Halloween update, but what is the actual news? The scarier-than-every Halloween sale yay! They talk about getting Halloween-themed costumes, masks, tails, and other stuff for 30% off in the item store, but no mention of anything else related to Jack-O\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;favorite time of year\u0026#34; I know, they still haven\u0026#39;t mentioned that they aren\u0026#39;t doing anything, but this seems like they would rather just throw up a sale, maybe make some extra money and have the whole holiday done and dusted!\nWhat has happened to Halloween? This is really my favorite time of year, always has been. I love any excuse to celebrate things scary, creepy, and even a bit gory (just don\u0026#39;t tell my friends üòâ), yet it seems everyone is just skipping over Halloween. I mean, I guess I get it, from a marking standpoint, Halloween, Thanksgiving (US), and Christmas are all right in line and the last two are very major holidays, and, with both Halloween and Christmas being about giving something out and getting something back, it makes since for companies like Gamigo to pour more energy into Christmas than Halloween. Doesn\u0026#39;t mean I have to like it though üò§\nI could be wrong Maybe, by the time this goes up and/or the time you read it, I\u0026#39;ve been proven wrong and Gamigo did, in fact, release the Halloween content I know and love.

I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I\u0026#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the \u0026#34;real\u0026#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven\u0026#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I\u0026#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it üòÖ I haven\u0026#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.\nGoogle Translate‚Ä¶NO! So umm, the Introduction has been written in Japanese. Other section home pages are not translated and really just say that, but the introduction page is translated. Here\u0026#39;s the problem. I failed to find some words in my old Japanese vocabulary and don\u0026#39;t have my old English to Japanese dictionary. Google Translate to the rescue, right!? Well kind of. Where has Google Translate can be a good English to Japanese, Japanese to English, or Any Language to Any Other Language dictionary, it isn\u0026#39;t so good at translating full sentences accurately, this is really more art the science. Sure, I\u0026#39;m 98% sure whatever its outputting can be understood by Japanese speakers, I\u0026#39;m not sure it maintains my tone and stuff. I\u0026#39;m also not sure if what it outputs is something Japanese speakers would really expect to hear, kinda hard to explain, but machine translation can sound too technical and or robotic and nothing like human speech even if it is technically correct.\nOf course, I know all this so I don\u0026#39;t use Google Translate like that, right? Well not exactly. Its easy to just throw a sentence in there see that the output makes since at least and then call it good enough. I try to avoid that, mostly by breaking down what I\u0026#39;m trying to say into something close to what I know how to say, but it happens. So I\u0026#39;m calling on anyone who knows both Japanese and English to help me!\nYou can help! At the bottom of each page is a comment box. I would really like these to be for general comments, but, in the case of the Japanese versions of each page I\u0026#39;d also like these to be used to help me with my Japanese and, more specifically, the translation of that page. You see, those comment boxes generate a GitHub issue I can look at, tag, and then implement, so, if you happen to have a GitHub account (or don\u0026#39;t mind making one üòâ) and know both Japanese and English near fluently than fill free to suggest corrections to the Japanese pages using the comment boxes.

Even if you haven\u0026#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform. First, I guess I little background information is in order.\nYaya\u0026#39;s World and how it was built before If you have visited the site and had a look at your address bar you may have noticed that page was a static HTML page. Every page had the same navigation bar, the same top bar, and the same header. Some might think this was done using Dreamweaver, and it was, at first. Recently though every page was actually written in a simple markup language, then it was built into HTML with all the standard stuff added in by a my editor of choice and that the result was then uploaded to a server. This allowed me to write and edit everything in a pretty distraction free way but still have navigation and everything working on each page on the site. Unfortunately, it became a bit of a chore to build the site and maintain all those template parts (the header and footer). So I just kinda stopped doing it ( ^ ~ ^ ;;\nHow I am trying to build the site now I recently came across an interesting YouTube video by someone named Chris Titus. He was showing off how he managed to keep is site up-to-date and do all the other things he does on a daily basis. I found this kinda of interesting and an answer to my problem of keeping my own site up-to-date. Now I am using Hugo with a theme he recommends to work on my site.\nWhat is Hugo? I don\u0026#39;t know if Hugo makes building websites fun again per se, but it certain makes things easier. Simply put Hugo is a framework for building websites. Its a program that I have installed on my MacBook that takes my ramblings written in Markdown or a similar markup language and builds HTML webpages with from them using a theme that provides some of the things my old site has. This can then be deployed to a my webserver, but this is almost exactly how things worked before only there is less gobbly goop that I have to maintain myself. However, Hugo does a bit more than just build the website.\nHow does Hugo help me? Aside from managing a theme and template for me where I use simple configurations to add and remove things that then apply to all pages and building a static site, Hugo provides a little webserver that allows me to see changes in realtime as I edit them. So I just type in my editor using a simple markup language than save those changes and then go to a browser that is already open to my local webserver and those changes are already applied, no need to hit refresh. This happens whether I\u0026#39;m changing a webpage, editing a theme configuration, or adding something new. I can literally see how it will look on the site before I deploy to the site all without having to hit refresh or anything but just looking at a browser window. Its really helpful. Also I was able to set up a little script I can run that will build and deploy the site with one command, so that\u0026#39;s also cool.\nA regression Everything isn\u0026#39;t quite peachy though. Many of the image-heavy pages, like the ADVENTURES gallery are not up anymore. This is a limitation of how I have Hugo set up currently. I\u0026#39;ll be looking into fixing this has I move forward, however, so hopefully all those memories will be back soon.\nPlans for the future So now I\u0026#39;m hoping to use this platform to expand the site beyond Fiesta Online. I\u0026#39;ve played many other games and, though I still spend most of my time playing MMOs in Fiesta Online, I would like to expand this site to include some of the other things that I end up playing, even things that might not be MMOs ( ^ . ~ ). I hope anyone who might be reading this will stick around and see how this site evolves in the coming months!\n-Yayoi\n","description":"This site is being moved to a new platform in hopes that I won't forget about updating it anymore ( ^ ~ ^ ;;","id":18,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"A New Platform a New Look!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-10-12/"},{"content":" While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep. After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn\u0026#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on. However, the group did encounter someone in Sea of Greed.\n\u0026#34;You lost your mama again, didn\u0026#39;t you?\u0026#34; Touka laughs.\n\u0026#34;None of your business, Touka!\u0026#34; Baby hisses.\n\u0026#34;What if I told you, I know where she went?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;d tell you to just leave me alone!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I could tell you, but it\u0026#39;ll cost ya!\u0026#34; Touka said, ignoring Baby\u0026#39;s pleas. Baby looked shocked. Of course Touka wouldn\u0026#39;t just do anything just to be nice. \u0026#34;How about 1000 gems!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s not fair!\u0026#34; Baby shouted. \u0026#34;Who even has that much!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay fine, but I\u0026#39;m not going to make this easy!\u0026#34; Touka responded, \u0026#34;How about I just tell you where some else who saw her went?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You should just tell us where Yayoi is?\u0026#34; Baby huffed.\n\u0026#34;Where\u0026#39;s the fun in that,\u0026#34; Touka teased. \u0026#34;Why not go find a pink haired cleric in a forest and see if she knows where your mama is!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Which other forest? There\u0026#39;s a ton of them!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know, but I know it is not far!\u0026#34;\nThe group of friends decided to take Baby to the Forest of Mist since it was very close to the Sea of Greed and, mostly by chance, they happened across a certain cleric that definitely fit Touka\u0026#39;s description.\n\u0026#34;Tama-mama!\u0026#34; Baby cried.\n\u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s wrong Baby?\u0026#34; Tama asked\n\u0026#34;Touka is being mean again‚Ä¶but that\u0026#39;s not the real problem.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;We\u0026#39;re looking for Yayoi,\u0026#34; Narumi, one of the friends, interjects.\n\u0026#34;Oh my goodness, you lost Yayoi!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Uh huh,\u0026#34; whimpered Baby.\n\u0026#34;Well, I did see her,\u0026#34; Tama explains, \u0026#34;but that was awhile ago. She looked like she was frantically searching for something. Maybe it was you.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Where was she looking?\u0026#34; inquired Narumi.\n\u0026#34;Well, I saw her in Vine Tomb, but I\u0026#39;m sure she was headed for a gate. Not sure which one, but I\u0026#39;m certain she\u0026#39;s not in Vine Tomb anymore.\u0026#34;\nThe group begins to deliberate. There are two gates in that area, but they decide to head to Dark Passage. They couldn\u0026#39;t find her there, but, since someone mentioned Moonlight Tomb, Narumi decided to head there ahead of everyone. She hears Yayoi shouting for Baby and informs the rest of her friends, who all head over to her.\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m so happy you found Baby again!\u0026#34; Yayoi exclaims.\n\u0026#34;Yayoi!\u0026#34; Baby cries.\nYayoi explains that she got separated from Baby and, instantly, and frantically started looking for her, eventually ending up in Moonlight Tomb where Narumi, and her friends, found her. She\u0026#39;s so happy to see BabyYayo again and vows to keep a better eye on her in the future. We shall see!\n","description":"Yayoi has lost BabyYayo!

Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I\u0026#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr. If you can\u0026#39;t get a spot I suggest having someone kill Guardian Masters for you. This is still fairly fast and there are several spots this can be done at. This is my favorite way to level. It isn\u0026#39;t as fast or exciting as FM, but it does the trick.\nIf this isn\u0026#39;t an option for you, or you\u0026#39;d rather take your time and experience the various areas of the game, then there are quests you can do at this level. All the regular quests are fairly easy and fast up to about level 30. In fact, in my opinion, this is the most fun way to level especially if you have a friend or two to level babies with. Below are a few repeatables you can do together to make things faster, especially after level 30, if you want üòâ\nRepeatable Quests (level 1-39) Despicable Little Ones - Little Hobs - Level 10 The Mini Greenky - Mini Greenkies - Level 11 Disease Carriers - Ratman - Level 12 Medical Herbs - Ratman with Herb Leaf - Level 12 Working for Karl - Broken Blade from Hooligan Phinoflies with Copper Ore (NQ and LQ) - Level 12 Clam Chowder - Boogy - Level 13 The Apple Thieves 2 - Boogy with Boogie\u0026#39;s egg from them - Level 13 - Available after completeting The Apple Thieves 1 Joker Kebings 2 - Joker Kebing - Level 18 - Available after completing Joker Kebings 1 Speedy Boogy 2 - Speedy Boogy - Level 18 - Available after completing Speedy Boogy 1 Herb Plant Set 2 - Herb Leaf, Herb Stem, and Herb Root (from gathering herbs) - Level 25 - Available after Herb Plant Set 1 Insomnia 2 - Glow Wolf - Level 25 - Available after completing Insomnia 1 Forzen Ice Cream 2 - Ice Vivi with Soft Ice Bits from them - Level 28 - Available after Frozen Ice Cream 1 The Oppression of Ghosts - Ghosts - Level 37 Harvest 2 - Hoes from Hobs - Level 38 - Available after completing Harvest 1 Bone Imp Bags 3 - Bone Imp Bags from Bone Imps - Level 39 - Available after completing Bone Imp bags 2 What to do at level 40? Those were not all the repeatable quests and you probably won\u0026#39;t need to complete a majority of them to reach level 40. For more information on quests you can visit the Fiesta Wiki. This will also help you complete pre-requisite quests for some of the reps above. Once your baby hits level 40 it is time for the Tower of Iyzel. Just because they are level 40, however, doesn\u0026#39;t mean that can beat the tower on their own. If you have a few friends, this could be pretty easy, but, if not, I should have an runner that can help you. Head to Roumen, visit Templar Maria and pick up all the quests that mention the tower than find a runner or get your party together and head to Forest of Mist to find the tower itself. With all the quests picked up, one run should get you to level 41 or 42. Congrats, you\u0026#39;re not a baby anymore ü•≥!\n","description":"Babies are levels 1-40","id":20,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Babies","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/babies/"},{"content":" If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.\nFrom this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently. In some cases you can gain up to four levels in a less than an hour, if you can catch the right quests. For now though, it is best to exploit Tower of Iyzel to get you to 41 or 42 than you should run around completing various 40-42 level quests until you reach level 43.\nHow best to exploit repeatables from level 43-80, in Yayoi\u0026#39;s opinion There are many leveling guides available. Each guide seems to have its own way of doing things and there are a lot of arguments over what is the best way to level a character. This is simply how I like to do things. If you are in a guild academy and managed a discord invite, see if your guild has a guide and feel free to experiment.\nLevel 43-44 Complete the quest \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; This will require you to 8 Goblin Swordman and pick up 3 Goblin Swords that they drop. Once you turn in \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; you will unlock the quest \u0026#34;A Bet with Marty 2\u0026#34;. This requires you to pick up 5 Goblin Swords from Goblin Swordsman and kill 10 of those mobs. This is a repeatable to quests. After a few turn ins you should be level 44 easy. Goblin Swordman are fairly easy mobs and can be soloed by characters at this level. For clerics, however, I highly recommend you gather them while a friend kills em. Don\u0026#39;t forget to heal your friend if they need it. Level 45-49 The repeatable above will still be available, but you will also gain access to two more repeatable quests at level 44, \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;. These both require items from the same mob so they can be used at the same time. \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; requires you to get 15 Warebear\u0026#39;s Claws from Ware Bears while \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;, available after completing the first two \u0026#34;Best Broomstick\u0026#34; quests requires 15 Warebear Arm bit Hairs. Ware Bears are a bit tougher, but can probably still be soloed by all classes accept clerics.\nLevel 49-52 At level 49, you can head to Scaffold Execution Ground through the Collapsed Prison portal. Right at this portal is a mob called Mini Lips. These will drop \u0026#34;Mini Lips\u0026#39; Lips\u0026#34; if you have the quest \u0026#34;Mannequin Lips\u0026#34;. Pick up 10 of these and turn in. Repeat until you reach level 52.\nLevel 52-55 Scaffold Execution Grounds also has a rather large pack of King Colls. These will drop \u0026#34;King Donkey Teeth\u0026#34; when you have the quest \u0026#34;The Unbreakable Chisel\u0026#34;. You can pick up this quest from the quest list at level 52. This is a fairly easy and quick (especially with a killer) way to get to level 55.\nLevel 55-60 Both Collapsed Prison and Scaffold Execution Grounds have prisoners, there are more of them in large groups in Collapsed prison. As part of the Level 55 quest \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 1\u0026#34; you need to kill ten of them. Once you turn this quest in, you can pick up \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 2\u0026#34;. You now need to kill 20 prisoners for a turn in, but this is a repeatable and a fairly easy way to reach level 60.\nLevel 60 Unfortunately, many of the above quests have expired or simply don\u0026#39;t provide enough experience to help you get to level 61, so now you can do all the other quests you\u0026#39;ve neglected up until now. Have fun üòù!\nLevel 61-70 The zombie crystal rep in Crystal Cave is the quickest way to clear these three levels. It does have a few prequests though, and will require a party. I should have a CC runner to help you though.\nSecond Tower 1 Second Tower 2 What I do? Reward for Dark Crystal 3 (this is the repeatable) Level 65-67 Greenkies repeat is the easiest way to clear this two levels. Do get you need to clear \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 1\u0026#34;. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 2\u0026#34;. Crystal Cave is, however, still available!\nLevel 69-70 Do the level 6x quests now. Alternatively there is also the mud rep. It is much easier to do this rep now than it was when I first came back and many guides still omit it. Truthfully, I would only use it if I need a few more exp to get to 70, but its always there if you need it. It is called \u0026#34;Hair Remover\u0026#34; and is available at level 68, no prequests needed.\nLevel 71-74 Navar rep. Seriously fast with a good party or a good killer. You will need to complete \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 1\u0026#34;, which requires you to gather 10 Navar Merc Liscences that the Nevars will occasionally drop and turn this back into Warrior Master Marty in Elderine (did I forget to mention that regular quests can no longer be turned in at the quest list as of level 60, personally, I hate that). Once you\u0026#39;ve done that you can pick up \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 2\u0026#34; from Marty and only count the kills.\nLevel 74-75 The repeatable quest \u0026#34;Nina\u0026#39;s Revenge\u0026#34; becomes available at level 74. This is often referred to as the \u0026#34;Nox Rep\u0026#34;. It is a fairly quick rep, but I have not run it myself for a while.\nLevel 74-76 Another repeatable quest that overlaps the one above a bit is \u0026#34;Goodbye, Nightmare!\u0026#34; This is referred to as the \u0026#34;Blue Archon rep\u0026#34; and you\u0026#39;ll be killing those. This is fairly quick and easy. If you like to take a break for Nox, you can switch between the two üòâ\nLevel 77-79 Not going to lie, I used to advocate for KKP from 70-80, but that is far from the best way to level especially after 76. My new suggestion is the Lizard Knight rep. Its best to have a party with this one though. Your party should have a killer (a mage or archer that can kill groups of Lizardman Knights at once), a mob herder (someone to run around on a +1 or better mount and gather the Lizardman Knights) and at 0-3 additional party members (these will help additional items spawn and we call them droppers) all with the quest. In the right conditions you can get to 79 vary quickly. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Monster Collector 2\u0026#34;, and its available once you have turned in \u0026#34;Master Collector 1\u0026#34;\nLevel 79 Nix rep. This one is fairly quick. The quest is called \u0026#34;Slay the Fire Nix\u0026#34;. Fire Nixes can be killed by a character at this level with some ease, but, as always, gathering them and having someone kill them with an AOE is much faster.\nMore Information As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for details on every quest. Congrats, you aren\u0026#39;t a newblet any more ü•≥!\n","description":"Newblets are still figuring things out, but they ain't babies no more. These are characters leveling 41-80.","id":21,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Newblets","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/newblets/"},{"content":" If you have followed my guides so far then you\u0026#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.\nHow best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too. For this stage I\u0026#39;m going to give you a few options for some of the levels. If you have the friends and money they\u0026#39;ll help you level really quickly, if you don\u0026#39;t than you can still solo, or work with a group of close friends your level, and still level, but it\u0026#39;ll be slower.\nLevel 80-90 There is a repeatable for gathering armor pieces in DT. You can have a higher level friend or a DT runner and a few droppers run through DT with you. Make sure you inventory is nearly empty and just fill it with these armor pieces. Once full, leave the dungeon and spam turn ins. Rinse and repeat until your level 90. Don\u0026#39;t forget to get the DT Key and quests. Alternatively, you can just do all the level 7x quests. There are a few somewhat boring reps mixed in there to help you get to 90. The slow way Here are the reps you can do to help you get to 90 if you can\u0026#39;t do DT for some reason:\nLevel 81-86 - Miner Mole Rep - \u0026#34;I Despise Moles\u0026#34; Level 82-87 - Another Mole Rep - \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s Them Again (Repeatable Quest)\u0026#34; Level 84-88 - Kidmon Rep - \u0026#34;Hans in Love\u0026#34; Level 85-88 - Toy Spade Rep - \u0026#34;Kidmon The Menance\u0026#34; Level 86-89 - Jewel Tree Rep - \u0026#34;Tree of Jewels\u0026#34; Level 89-90 - Lava Gargoyle Rep - \u0026#34;Attack of the Lava Gargoyles\u0026#34; Level 90-101 You can now enter Leviathan Nest. You need to complete the quest \u0026#34;Lost Key to the Lighthouse\u0026#34; to get the key. This requires you to slay Nest Slime, which is kinda strong for its level, best to have a friend help. Once here you have the key, you can find a guildie, friend, or other LN runner and just stand around and gather exp. This is nice because you can level while you AFK like in FM, but it can be expansive because runners don\u0026#39;t run it for free, usually. Alternatively, there is a non-LN strategy that is not as easy and is a bit slower, but more than doable. Also, at this point you may begin to do daily quests from the Hunter\u0026#39;s Union. These will allow you to earn tokens to exchange for items and give you a bit of exp every day! The slow way Level 90-94 - RS Rep - Complete the following: \u0026#34;Burning Cave\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Burning Cave 2\u0026#34; to unlock \u0026#34;My hunches never proves wrong\u0026#34; - Rock Stone is also hard to kill for someone at this level, but I love killing RS so just get in-touch with me, or you can have another high level guildie or friend kill it for you while you turn in the rep. Level 94-95 - Mandrake Rep - \u0026#34;Outlaw of the Swamp (Repeatable)\u0026#34; - 15 Kill per turn in now! Much better than doing all the other quests, but you could still do those if you want. Level 96-97 - King Rhino Rep - \u0026#34;The Threats of King Rhinoce\u0026#34; - Pretty easy mini-boss, may even be able to solo him, but a higher level killer is faster. Level 98 - do all the 9x quests to get you to 99, if you\u0026#39;re having difficulty reaching 99 even with daily quest and these normal quests, there is also the Ping Pig Horn rep - \u0026#34;Food Thief\u0026#34;, but this is a drop quest and can be difficult to in a party, so it is not recommended. Level 99-101 Whether you did or LN or not the next quest is \u0026#34;Personal Revenge\u0026#34;, which is known as the \u0026#34;Slugs Rep\u0026#34; and should not be confused with the \u0026#34;Mad slugs rep\u0026#34;!\nLevel 101 The \u0026#34;Mad Slugs Rep\u0026#34; mentioned above is a good way to pass level 101, it isn\u0026#39;t very good after that level, but it does remain available. You will have to unlock it though by completing a chain of quests starting with \u0026#34;Suspicious Big Mudmen\u0026#34;. This will unlock \u0026#34;Fire on Hands and Feet\u0026#34; which will finally unlock \u0026#34;Unextinguishable Fire\u0026#34;, which is this rep.\nLevel 102-106 Next repeatable quest is \u0026#34;Black Bear Beatdown\u0026#34; or just BBs. It has been determined that this is now faster than Mad Slugs, though that is still available for you.\nLevel 105 If you did LN above, then just do the BB rep mentioned in the slow way to get you to 106.\nLevel 106-108 Okie, most of the shortcuts are done now so, no matter what, you\u0026#39;re going to have to grind a bit. Fortunately it isn\u0026#39;t really hard. Just remember that a lot of people are going to be doing these quests, see if you can join a party with a dedicated killer and this will go much faster. For these levels, you have the Fire Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Playing with Fire\u0026#34;).\nLevel 109 Complete all quests you\u0026#39;ve saved until this point. If you haven\u0026#39;t had to do the 9x quests than this will be very quick. Otherwise, the quests in OLT are here and they are also fairly quick with any other quests you saved up. OLT is best tackled with a party though.\nLevel 110-116 Nepu Nepu Neeeeep! Its time for the Nep rep. Complete \u0026#34;Collecting Twister Crystals\u0026#34; before getting the repeatable version. Believe it or not, there is nothing to collect for this rep, just killing.\nLevel 112-116 If you can, stay on Neps! There are two additional repeatables avaialble though. Either Mean Leipoons (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 1\u0026#34;) or Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 2\u0026#34;). It is important to note that you will have to completely The Mean Leipoons rep a twice times before the Shellas rep shows up. Its weird, but true.\nLevel 116-118 Wrenches rep. Unfortunately, this quest is buried under a loooong list of prequests, but here they are: \u0026#34;Milly\u0026#39;s Healthy Wonder Medicine 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Unknown Causes.. However\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. Once these are complete you\u0026#39;ll get the repeatable version of \u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. It should also be noted that you can make a ton of money by doing \u0026#34;The Workshop Master is making a weapon\u0026#34; (available at 117) while you are doing the wrenches rep, not to mention this boosts your exp too. It should be mentioned that \u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34; is also a repeatable quest and can be done the same time as wrenches.\nLevel 118-121 Junks rep. This is also buried under a loooong list of prequests (but it is worth it! these quests will give you a lot of exp and the rep gives 2-3% per turn it üò≤), so I\u0026#39;ll give you those too. \u0026#34;Smart Yeti is preparing for an Exam\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Something urgent came up to Hilda\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Sick Akisha\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;North Witch\u0026#39;s dark power\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Someone can help us..

After aaall these quests, you\u0026#39;ll finally get \u0026#34;Selling Junks\u0026#34;\nI\u0026#39;ve learned something just recently. There are a quite a few quests that you can do during this level, including a ton of repeatables. Junks is, by far, the fastest way, but it can be dangerous because of all the Astan\u0026#39;s nearby. For this reason I recommend having a good party with someone tanky to pull and a good killer that could, if needed, one-shot the Astans if they get close. Bonus, a party should be able to tell you exactly where to stand, sit on your mount, or rest during the rep to minimize your likelihood of dying, however, if you don\u0026#39;t have a lot of friends, there are easier, but slower reps. As I mentioned, a TON of them. Just don\u0026#39;t get discouraged by how slow you gain exp. Also, if your in a guild that likes to do Siren\u0026#39;s Castle raids and has a few good runners, ask if you can tag along for quests. This will be a good way to gain looots of exp at once, but be sure they are okay with you joining and it would probably good to spend some money on scrolls, tevas and charms, don\u0026#39;t forget to grab all the dungeon quests, they should have a sword icon!\nCongrats You are now a bone-fide adventurer. You are still 20 levels away from cap, but keep it up! As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for more information on any of the quests above.\n","description":"Fledging Adventurers are characters from level 81-120, not their yet, but almost.","id":22,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Fledgling Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/fledgling/"},{"content":" After following my guide thus far you\u0026#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) üòÖ So, hopefully, you\u0026#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps üòú Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.\nHow Best to Exploit repeatables from 121 to cap, according to Yayoi Okay, okay, all of the reps from here on, well from 116 on really, have a looooooooot of prequests, but they are pretty much essential for leveling now, so there isn\u0026#39;t much you can do about it, sadly. Just hunker down, grab some friends, and grind, grind, grind.\nLevels 121-123 Do the Beaks and Shellas repeat (if you can\u0026#39;t tell there are too many different types of Shellas in this game üòÜ). To get this repeat complete these quests in this order. \u0026#34;Embarrassed Basilone\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone is avoiding to answer\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Bailone\u0026#39;s Colleagues\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues belongings 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Present for Jey\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s Colleague\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s Lie\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Suspicious Basilone\u0026#34;. That is seriously a lot üòµ‚Äçüí´, but it will unlock \u0026#34;Continues Suspicion\u0026#34;, a fairly good rep, and give you quite a lot of exp to boot, so it isn\u0026#39;t all bad.\nLevels 124-126 When I was new I had a friend who insisted the wood rep was a good one to do here, but I think they just liked it because it was an easy solo question ü§≠. If you want you can look it up, but there are better quests. In fact there are two repeatables that are much faster! Also, there is the Bijou Sancturary KQ.\nIf you want to unlock the two repeatables each on has a bit of a quest chain:\n\u0026#34;The Henneath Alliance power is needed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Vale Megantereon\u0026#39;s threat\u0026#34; \u0026#34;The Henneath Alliance power is needed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Nicolas\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Vale Snowy Wolf\u0026#39;s threat\u0026#34; Level 125 Again, the rep here is slow, so quest and do BS KQ. If you don\u0026#39;t quite make it to 126, or you\u0026#39;re tired of running around complete these prequests: \u0026#34;Ancient Scriptures (1-5)\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Oh Captain, My Captain! (1-7)\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;The Arrival‚Äù\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Lending A Hand\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Nighttime disturbance\u0026#34;. After that, you\u0026#39;ll gain two reps \u0026#34;Their Health Is In Danger\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Nighttime disurbance\u0026#34;. In the right spot, both reps can be done together.\nLevel 126-128 You can do the maru rep for this level though the previous rep is available if you want to stick to it. The maru rep is known as \u0026#34;Protecting the Camp\u0026#34;\nYou can also start the mushies rep. This rep takes 6-8 hours with a full party of droppers (be nice and save the quest so you can be a dropper for others). To get this rep you only need to complete the \u0026#34;Mushrooms for Ursula\u0026#34; prequest. Note (because no one told me this): You will need one basket from the item merchant in Isle of Eya for the prequest and then a second one for the rep. Just make sure to keep the basket in your inventory until your done.\nLevels 128-130 The second wood rep. This is much faster than mushies, but is still better with a full party of droppers. Just look for \u0026#34;Serben and His Woods\u0026#34;. The first will be a non-repeatable, turn it back into to Serben to get the repeatable version.\nLevels 130-135 From this point until cap, you will want to make sure you complete your daily quests and compete in available KQs. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 game time. You have some rep options to help fill your time.\nLevel 130-131 - \u0026#34;Success is everything\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 1\u0026#34; Level 130-132 - \u0026#34;Front Lines\u0026#34; Level 132-134 - \u0026#34;The Predator Leader\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 2\u0026#34; Level 134-135 - \u0026#34;The Final Ingredient\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 3\u0026#34; Final Note: The 135 reps are very slow. Focus on your dailies and KQS and complete any quests you haven\u0026#39;t done those far (aside from those your dropping for) to help move things a bit faster.\n","description":"Bone-fide adventurers are characters leveling from 121-135, these are their stories","id":23,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Bone-fide Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/adventurer/"},{"content":" When I first wrote my last guide the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next.

As I said above, there are no KQs for passed 135 that offer any significant amount of exp, however, many of the hidden dailies and other daily quests you got when you got to 132 are still viable passed 135 and offer some exp. A member of one a guild I am in has broken down the amount of exp, in percentage, that you receive for various levels passed 135. Please note: this is the percentage if you complete all available dailies quests, not the percentage per quest!\n135 - 16.70% 136 - 13.22% 137 - 11.02% 138 - 9.07% 139 - 4.60% New Reps!

Well a couple anyway.\nYuna 3 (135-136) Soul Rep (136-138) Bug Rep (138-139) Questing The fiesta wiki offers a few options for quests for this level range. It has been recommended to relay on dailies and reps until at least 139. This will allow you to save your quests for when normal quests are suuuper in-effective, and hopefully make that last level just a little faster.\n","description":"The current cap is 140, these are adventurers that are a stone's throw from that (135-140) so yeah, pretty god-like!","id":24,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"God-like Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/gods/"},{"content":" Before we begin, it is important to understand that everything in Fiesta is divided into tiers, this includes weapons, armor, and jewlery. Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones. For your reference:\nTier 1 refers to level 1~20 items Tier 2 refers to level 20~50 Tier 3 to 51~80 Tier 4 to 81-99 Tier 5 to 100+ Tier 6 is rserved for lgendary weapons. Enhacement Breakage When enhancing and item, there is a possibility it will break. However, some items seem to have a kind of safe zone in which they won\u0026#39;t break until a certain point. There is still a chance of downgrading, but that doesn\u0026#39;t cause you to lose the item like breaking. Here are the safe zones:\nGenerally best to follow the rule of safe until +3, but here are the more specific safe zones:\nTier 1 never break up to +5 Tier 2 and Tier 3 don\u0026#39;t break until +4 Tier 4 and Tier 5 don\u0026#39;t break until +3 Maximum Enhancement Just how high can you enhance items?

The tier of the stone needs to be equal to the tier of the item, as mentioned above.\nTier 1-5 enhacement stones for weapons, gears, and accessories\nElrue: +1, +2, and +3 Lix: +4, +5, and +6 Xir: +7, +8 and +9 Karis: +10, +11, and +12 These stones come in tree colors:\nGreen are normal, they have no special effects and will increase by +1 Purple are Blessed, they have a higher chance of upgrading by +1 and even a very small chance of upgrading +2 Blue are lucky their chance of upgrade is lower than blessed, but it has a higher chance to upgrade by +2 As a general rule NEVER use a lucky elrue when your enhancing a +2 weapon or gear at tier 4 or 5! According to users of the forums: \u0026#34;The chance of breakage is low, but it CAN HAPPEN, and it happened with a lot of us.\u0026#34;\nAs Tier 6 weapons are special they use a special enhacement stone called \u0026#34;Crystal of bijou\u0026#34; for all of their stages (+1 ~ +12)\nBracelets also use a special \u0026#39;stone\u0026#39; for enhancing.

I won\u0026#39;t go into details as to which class works best in which role as that is laid out very well on Fiesta\u0026#39;s Main Site. However builds can be tricky since each class has its own strength and weaknesses while its leveling such that what works for Archers my not work for Mages (even though they both specialize in AoE). So, here are the generally accepted builds and what classes to use with them üòâ.\nAll STR This is easy as from the start, you just dump all of your skill points into STR. At first this seems like a really good build for all characters, but a character without DEF dies üòµ. One might be tempted to use this for a tank role, but tanks are supposed to take dmg not give it. Really the only classes where this build works is Crusader, as they have good DEF by default and also have support skills, and Fighter (Gladiator Specifically) that focus more on DD roles than tanking.\nClasses: üó°üõ°üëªüèπ\nFull END Like All STR, full END just has you dump all of your points in one stat, in this case END. This will maximize your health and defenses. This is well suited for support classes, especially clerics, and tanks. People tend do die if the clericor tank dies so the more defense and HP they have the better.\nClasses: üõ°üó°‚úùÔ∏è\nTotally DEX Dumping all your points into DEX may seem odd, but some classes can really utilize this well. Besides who needs DEF if the mobs can\u0026#39;t even hit you ü§™. Keep in mind though, you are sacrificing your potential in other areas. This really only makes since when you can kill fairly quickly too, so only DDs really, and you will still need some DEF. Just be careful with this one.\nClasses: üëªüèπ\nPure SPR I\u0026#39;m listing this just because its a possibility to maximize your character\u0026#39;s SP, M.DEF, and crit rate, but you will need very good gear or you still won\u0026#39;t do much dmg and will probably die a lot too üòÖ.\nClasses: üßôüèπ\n33 DEX/Rest STR The above DD build (All STR) is great, but it ignores aim. Sprinkling in a few points to SPR, until you have 33 (or maximum of 67) fixes this helping your DD hit more often. This build is well suited for all those recommended for the All STR builds.\nClasses: üó°üõ°üëª\n25 SPR/Rest END The above support build (Full END) is also great, but it ignores SP and crit rate. You can sprinkle in a few points into SPR until you have 25 to fix this, I highly recommend this build for Holy Knights since they tend to burn through available SP, also anyone in a support role can use some extra crits when they need to solo üòâ.\nClasses: üõ°üó°‚úùÔ∏è\n25 SPR/33 DEX/Rest STR This build maximize your attack power and crit rate while making it you a hard target to hit. You can use gear to help with DEF and M.DEF.\nClasses: üèπüßôüëª\n50 END/33 DEX/25 SPR/Rest STR If you\u0026#39;re looking for a wellrounded build that is nearly perfect for player-versus-player (PVP), this is the build for you. A reminder though, this is a jack-of-all-trades/master-of-none type situation, and many classesw have gear and armor to help with stats like END.\nClasses: üõ°üèπüßôüëª\n","description":"A basic overview of the types of builds in Fiesta Online","id":28,"section":"guides","tags":["guide"],"title":"Builds","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/builds/"}]
