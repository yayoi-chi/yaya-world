[{"content":" The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I\u0026#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr. If you can\u0026#39;t get a spot I suggest having someone kill Guardian Masters for you. This is still fairly fast and there are several spots this can be done at. This is my favorite way to level. It isn\u0026#39;t as fast or exciting as FM, but it does the trick.\nIf this isn\u0026#39;t an option for you, or you\u0026#39;d rather take your time and experience the various areas of the game, then there are quests you can do at this level. All the regular quests are fairly easy and fast up to about level 30. In fact, in my opinion, this is the most fun way to level especially if you have a friend or two to level babies with. Below are a few repeatables you can do together to make things faster, especially after level 30, if you want 😉\nRepeatable Quests (level 1-39) Despicable Little Ones - Little Hobs - Level 10 The Mini Greenky - Mini Greenkies - Level 11 Disease Carriers - Ratman - Level 12 Medical Herbs - Ratman with Herb Leaf - Level 12 Working for Karl - Broken Blade from Hooligan Phinoflies with Copper Ore (NQ and LQ) - Level 12 Clam Chowder - Boogy - Level 13 The Apple Thieves 2 - Boogy with Boogie\u0026#39;s egg from them - Level 13 - Available after completeting The Apple Thieves 1 Joker Kebings 2 - Joker Kebing - Level 18 - Available after completing Joker Kebings 1 Speedy Boogy 2 - Speedy Boogy - Level 18 - Available after completing Speedy Boogy 1 Herb Plant Set 2 - Herb Leaf, Herb Stem, and Herb Root (from gathering herbs) - Level 25 - Available after Herb Plant Set 1 Insomnia 2 - Glow Wolf - Level 25 - Available after completing Insomnia 1 Forzen Ice Cream 2 - Ice Vivi with Soft Ice Bits from them - Level 28 - Available after Frozen Ice Cream 1 The Oppression of Ghosts - Ghosts - Level 37 Harvest 2 - Hoes from Hobs - Level 38 - Available after completing Harvest 1 Bone Imp Bags 3 - Bone Imp Bags from Bone Imps - Level 39 - Available after completing Bone Imp bags 2 What to do at level 40? Those were not all the repeatable quests and you probably won\u0026#39;t need to complete a majority of them to reach level 40. For more information on quests you can visit the Fiesta Wiki. This will also help you complete pre-requisite quests for some of the reps above. Once your baby hits level 40 it is time for the Tower of Iyzel. Just because they are level 40, however, doesn\u0026#39;t mean that can beat the tower on their own. If you have a few friends, this could be pretty easy, but, if not, I should have an runner that can help you. Head to Roumen, visit Templar Maria and pick up all the quests that mention the tower than find a runner or get your party together and head to Forest of Mist to find the tower itself. With all the quests picked up, one run should get you to level 41 or 42. Congrats, you\u0026#39;re not a baby anymore 🥳!\n","description":"Babies are levels 1-40","id":0,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Babies","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/babies/"},{"content":" If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.\nFrom this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently. In some cases you can gain up to four levels in a less than an hour, if you can catch the right quests. For now though, it is best to exploit Tower of Iyzel to get you to 41 or 42 than you should run around completing various 40-42 level quests until you reach level 43.\nHow best to exploit repeatables from level 43-80, in Yayoi\u0026#39;s opinion There are many leveling guides available. Each guide seems to have its own way of doing things and there are a lot of arguments over what is the best way to level a character. This is simply how I like to do things. If you are in a guild academy and managed a discord invite, see if your guild has a guide and feel free to experiment.\nLevel 43-44 Complete the quest \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; This will require you to 8 Goblin Swordman and pick up 3 Goblin Swords that they drop. Once you turn in \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; you will unlock the quest \u0026#34;A Bet with Marty 2\u0026#34;. This requires you to pick up 5 Goblin Swords from Goblin Swordsman and kill 10 of those mobs. This is a repeatable to quests. After a few turn ins you should be level 44 easy. Goblin Swordman are fairly easy mobs and can be soloed by characters at this level. For clerics, however, I highly recommend you gather them while a friend kills em. Don\u0026#39;t forget to heal your friend if they need it. Level 45-49 The repeatable above will still be available, but you will also gain access to two more repeatable quests at level 44, \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;. These both require items from the same mob so they can be used at the same time. \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; requires you to get 15 Warebear\u0026#39;s Claws from Ware Bears while \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;, available after completing the first two \u0026#34;Best Broomstick\u0026#34; quests requires 15 Warebear Arm bit Hairs. Ware Bears are a bit tougher, but can probably still be soloed by all classes accept clerics.\nLevel 49-52 At level 49, you can head to Scaffold Execution Ground through the Collapsed Prison portal. Right at this portal is a mob called Mini Lips. These will drop \u0026#34;Mini Lips\u0026#39; Lips\u0026#34; if you have the quest \u0026#34;Mannequin Lips\u0026#34;. Pick up 10 of these and turn in. Repeat until you reach level 52.\nLevel 52-55 Scaffold Execution Grounds also has a rather large pack of King Colls. These will drop \u0026#34;King Donkey Teeth\u0026#34; when you have the quest \u0026#34;The Unbreakable Chisel\u0026#34;. You can pick up this quest from the quest list at level 52. This is a fairly easy and quick (especially with a killer) way to get to level 55.\nLevel 55-60 Both Collapsed Prison and Scaffold Execution Grounds have prisoners, there are more of them in large groups in Collapsed prison. As part of the Level 55 quest \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 1\u0026#34; you need to kill ten of them. Once you turn this quest in, you can pick up \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 2\u0026#34;. You now need to kill 20 prisoners for a turn in, but this is a repeatable and a fairly easy way to reach level 60.\nLevel 60 Unfortunately, many of the above quests have expired or simply don\u0026#39;t provide enough experience to help you get to level 61, so now you can do all the other quests you\u0026#39;ve neglected up until now. Have fun 😝!\nLevel 61-70 The zombie crystal rep in Crystal Cave is the quickest way to clear these three levels. It does have a few prequests though, and will require a party. I should have a CC runner to help you though.\nSecond Tower 1 Second Tower 2 What I do? Reward for Dark Crystal 3 (this is the repeatable) Level 65-67 Greenkies repeat is the easiest way to clear this two levels. Do get you need to clear \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 1\u0026#34;. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 2\u0026#34;. Crystal Cave is, however, still available!\nLevel 69-70 Do the level 6x quests now. Alternatively there is also the mud rep. It is much easier to do this rep now than it was when I first came back and many guides still omit it. Truthfully, I would only use it if I need a few more exp to get to 70, but its always there if you need it. It is called \u0026#34;Hair Remover\u0026#34; and is available at level 68, no prequests needed.\nLevel 71-74 Navar rep. Seriously fast with a good party or a good killer. You will need to complete \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 1\u0026#34;, which requires you to gather 10 Navar Merc Liscences that the Nevars will occasionally drop and turn this back into Warrior Master Marty in Elderine (did I forget to mention that regular quests can no longer be turned in at the quest list as of level 60, personally, I hate that). Once you\u0026#39;ve done that you can pick up \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 2\u0026#34; from Marty and only count the kills.\nLevel 74-75 The repeatable quest \u0026#34;Nina\u0026#39;s Revenge\u0026#34; becomes available at level 74. This is often referred to as the \u0026#34;Nox Rep\u0026#34;. It is a fairly quick rep, but I have not run it myself for a while.\nLevel 74-76 Another repeatable quest that overlaps the one above a bit is \u0026#34;Goodbye, Nightmare!\u0026#34; This is referred to as the \u0026#34;Blue Archon rep\u0026#34; and you\u0026#39;ll be killing those. This is fairly quick and easy. If you like to take a break for Nox, you can switch between the two 😉\nLevel 77-79 Not going to lie, I used to advocate for KKP from 70-80, but that is far from the best way to level especially after 76. My new suggestion is the Lizard Knight rep. Its best to have a party with this one though. Your party should have a killer (a mage or archer that can kill groups of Lizardman Knights at once), a mob herder (someone to run around on a +1 or better mount and gather the Lizardman Knights) and at 0-3 additional party members (these will help additional items spawn and we call them droppers) all with the quest. In the right conditions you can get to 79 vary quickly. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Monster Collector 2\u0026#34;, and its available once you have turned in \u0026#34;Master Collector 1\u0026#34;\nLevel 79 Nix rep. This one is fairly quick. The quest is called \u0026#34;Slay the Fire Nix\u0026#34;. Fire Nixes can be killed by a character at this level with some ease, but, as always, gathering them and having someone kill them with an AOE is much faster.\nMore Information As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for details on every quest. Congrats, you aren\u0026#39;t a newblet any more 🥳!\n","description":"Newblets are still figuring things out, but they ain't babies no more. These are characters leveling 41-80.","id":1,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Newblets","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/newblets/"},{"content":" If you have followed my guides so far then you\u0026#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.\nHow best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too. For this stage I\u0026#39;m going to give you a few options for some of the levels. If you have the friends and money they\u0026#39;ll help you level really quickly, if you don\u0026#39;t than you can still solo, or work with a group of close friends your level, and still level, but it\u0026#39;ll be slower.\nLevel 80-90 There is a repeatable for gathering armor pieces in DT. You can have a higher level friend or a DT runner and a few droppers run through DT with you. Make sure you inventory is nearly empty and just fill it with these armor pieces. Once full, leave the dungeon and spam turn ins. Rinse and repeat until your level 90. Don\u0026#39;t forget to get the DT Key and quests. Alternatively, you can just do all the level 7x quests. There are a few somewhat boring reps mixed in there to help you get to 90. The slow way Here are the reps you can do to help you get to 90 if you can\u0026#39;t do DT for some reason:\nLevel 81-84 - Miner Mole Rep - \u0026#34;I Despise Moles\u0026#34; Level 82-84 - Another Mole Rep - \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s Them Again (Repeatable Quest)\u0026#34; Level 84-86 - Kidmon Rep - \u0026#34;Hans in Love\u0026#34; Level 85-88 - Toy Spade Rep - \u0026#34;Kidmon The Menance\u0026#34; Level 86-89 - Jewel Tree Rep - \u0026#34;Tree of Jewels\u0026#34; Level 89-91 - Lava Gargoyle Rep - \u0026#34;Attack of the Lava Gargoyles\u0026#34; Level 90-101 You can now enter Leviathan Nest. You need to complete the quest \u0026#34;Lost Key to the Lighthouse\u0026#34; to get the key. This requires you to slay Nest Slime, which is kinda strong for its level, best to have a friend help. Once here you have the key, you can find a guildie, friend, or other LN runner and just stand around and gather exp. This is nice because you can level while you AFK like in FM, but it can be expansive because runners don\u0026#39;t run it for free, usually. Alternatively, there is a non-LN strategy that is not as easy and is a bit slower, but more than doable. Also, at this point you may begin to do daily quests from the Hunter\u0026#39;s Union. These will allow you to earn tokens to exchange for items and give you a bit of exp every day! The slow way Level 90-94 - RS Rep - Complete the following: \u0026#34;Burning Cave\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Burning Cave 2\u0026#34; to unlock \u0026#34;My hunches never proves wrong\u0026#34; - Rock Stone is also hard to kill for someone at this level, but I love killing RS so just get in-touch with me, or you can have another high level guildie or friend kill it for you while you turn in the rep. Also, the spot in burning cave has a few gargoyles so it is possible to do both quests at once, at least for one level. Level 94-95 - Mandrake Rep - \u0026#34;Outlaw of the Swamp (Repeatable)\u0026#34; - 15 Kill per turn in now! Much better than doing all the other quests, but you could still do those if you want. Level 96-97 - King Rhino Rep - \u0026#34;The Threats of King Rhinoce\u0026#34; - Pretty easy mini-boss, may even be able to solo him, but a higher level killer is faster. Level 98 - do all the 9x quests to get you to 99, if you\u0026#39;re having difficulty reaching 99 even with daily quest and these normal quests, there is also the Ping Pig Horn rep - \u0026#34;Food Thief\u0026#34;, but this is a drop quest and can be difficult to in a party, so it is not recommended. Level 99-101 Whether you did or LN or not the next quest is \u0026#34;Personal Revenge\u0026#34;, which is known as the \u0026#34;Slugs Rep\u0026#34; and should not be confused with the \u0026#34;Mad slugs rep\u0026#34;!\nLevel 101 The \u0026#34;Mad Slugs Rep\u0026#34; mentioned above is a good way to pass level 101, it isn\u0026#39;t very good after that level, but it does remain available. You will have to unlock it though by completing a chain of quests starting with \u0026#34;Suspicious Big Mudmen\u0026#34;. This will unlock \u0026#34;Fire on Hands and Feet\u0026#34; which will finally unlock \u0026#34;Unextinguishable Fire\u0026#34;, which is this rep.\nLevel 102-106 Next repeatable quest is \u0026#34;Black Bear Beatdown\u0026#34; or just BBs. It has been determined that this is now faster than Mad Slugs, though that is still available for you.\nLevel 105 If you did LN above, then just do the BB rep mentioned in the slow way to get you to 106.\nLevel 106-108 Okie, most of the shortcuts are done now so, no matter what, you\u0026#39;re going to have to grind a bit. Fortunately it isn\u0026#39;t really hard. Just remember that a lot of people are going to be doing these quests, see if you can join a party with a dedicated killer and this will go much faster. For these levels, you have the Fire Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Playing with Fire\u0026#34;).\nLevel 109 Complete all quests you\u0026#39;ve saved until this point. If you haven\u0026#39;t had to do the 9x quests than this will be very quick. Otherwise, the quests in OLT are here and they are also fairly quick with any other quests you saved up. OLT is best tackled with a party though.\nLevel 110-116 Nepu Nepu Neeeeep! Its time for the Nep rep. Complete \u0026#34;Collecting Twister Crystals\u0026#34; before getting the repeatable version. Believe it or not, there is nothing to collect for this rep, just killing.\nLevel 112-116 If you can, stay on Neps! There are two additional repeatables avaialble though. Either Mean Leipoons (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 1\u0026#34;) or Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 2\u0026#34;). It is important to note that you will have to completely The Mean Leipoons rep a twice times before the Shellas rep shows up. Its weird, but true.\nLevel 116-118 Wrenches rep. Unfortunately, this quest is buried under a loooong list of prequests, but here they are: \u0026#34;Milly\u0026#39;s Healthy Wonder Medicine 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Unknown Causes.. However\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. Once these are complete you\u0026#39;ll get the repeatable version of \u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. It should also be noted that you can make a ton of money by doing \u0026#34;The Workshop Master is making a weapon\u0026#34; (available at 117) while you are doing the wrenches rep, not to mention this boosts your exp too. It should be mentioned that \u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34; is also a repeatable quest and can be done the same time as wrenches.\nLevel 118-121 Junks rep. This is also buried under a loooong list of prequests (but it is worth it! these quests will give you a lot of exp and the rep gives 2-3% per turn it 😲), so I\u0026#39;ll give you those too. \u0026#34;Smart Yeti is preparing for an Exam\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Something urgent came up to Hilda\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Sick Akisha\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;North Witch\u0026#39;s dark power\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Someone can help us..

After aaall these quests, you\u0026#39;ll finally get \u0026#34;Selling Junks\u0026#34;\nI\u0026#39;ve learned something just recently. There are a quite a few quests that you can do during this level, including a ton of repeatables. Junks is, by far, the fastest way, but it can be dangerous because of all the Astan\u0026#39;s nearby. For this reason I recommend having a good party with someone tanky to pull and a good killer that could, if needed, one-shot the Astans if they get close. Bonus, a party should be able to tell you exactly where to stand, sit on your mount, or rest during the rep to minimize your likelihood of dying, however, if you don\u0026#39;t have a lot of friends, there are easier, but slower reps. As I mentioned, a TON of them. Just don\u0026#39;t get discouraged by how slow you gain exp. Also, if your in a guild that likes to do Siren\u0026#39;s Castle raids and has a few good runners, ask if you can tag along for quests. This will be a good way to gain looots of exp at once, but be sure they are okay with you joining and it would probably good to spend some money on scrolls, tevas and charms, don\u0026#39;t forget to grab all the dungeon quests, they should have a sword icon!\nCongrats You are now a bone-fide adventurer. You are still 20 levels away from cap, but keep it up! As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for more information on any of the quests above.\n","description":"Fledging Adventurers are characters from level 81-120, not their yet, but almost.","id":2,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Fledgling Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/fledgling/"},{"content":" After following my guide thus far you\u0026#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you\u0026#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.\nHow Best to Exploit repeatables from 121 to cap, according to Yayoi Okay, okay, all of the reps from here on, well from 116 on really, have a looooooooot of prequests, but they are pretty much essential for leveling now, so there isn\u0026#39;t much you can do about it, sadly. Just hunker down, grab some friends, and grind, grind, grind.\nLevels 121-123 Do the Beaks and Shellas repeat (if you can\u0026#39;t tell there are too many different types of Shellas in this game 😆). To get this repeat complete these quests in this order. \u0026#34;Embarrassed Basilone\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone is avoiding to answer\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Bailone\u0026#39;s Colleagues\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues belongings 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Present for Jey\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s Colleague\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s Lie\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Suspicious Basilone\u0026#34;. That is seriously a lot 😵‍💫, but it will unlock \u0026#34;Continues Suspicion\u0026#34;, a fairly good rep, and give you quite a lot of exp to boot, so it isn\u0026#39;t all bad.\nLevels 124-126 When I was new I had a friend who insisted the wood rep was a good one to do here, but I think they just liked it because it was an easy solo question 🤭. If you want you can look it up, but there are better quests. In fact there are two repeatables that are much faster! Also, there is the Bijou Sancturary KQ.\nIf you want to unlock the two repeatables each on has a bit of a quest chain:\n\u0026#34;The Henneath Alliance power is needed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Vale Megantereon\u0026#39;s threat\u0026#34; \u0026#34;The Henneath Alliance power is needed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Nicolas\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s decision\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;Vale Snowy Wolf\u0026#39;s threat\u0026#34; Level 125 Again, the rep here is slow, so quest and do BS KQ. If you don\u0026#39;t quite make it to 126, or you\u0026#39;re tired of running around complete these prequests: \u0026#34;Ancient Scriptures (1-5)\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Oh Captain, My Captain! (1-7)\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;The Arrival”\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Lending A Hand\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Nighttime disturbance\u0026#34;. After that, you\u0026#39;ll gain two reps \u0026#34;Their Health Is In Danger\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Nighttime disurbance\u0026#34;. In the right spot, both reps can be done together.\nLevel 126-128 You can do the maru rep for this level though the previous rep is available if you want to stick to it. The maru rep is known as \u0026#34;Protecting the Camp\u0026#34;\nYou can also start the mushies rep. This rep takes 6-8 hours with a full party of droppers (be nice and save the quest so you can be a dropper for others). To get this rep you only need to complete the \u0026#34;Mushrooms for Ursula\u0026#34; prequest. Note (because no one told me this): You will need one basket from the item merchant in Isle of Eya for the prequest and then a second one for the rep. Just make sure to keep the basket in your inventory until your done.\nLevels 128-130 The second wood rep. This is much faster than mushies, but is still better with a full party of droppers. Just look for \u0026#34;Serben and His Woods\u0026#34;. The first will be a non-repeatable, turn it back into to Serben to get the repeatable version.\nLevels 130-135 From this point until cap, you will want to make sure you complete your daily quests and compete in available KQs. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 game time. You have some rep options to help fill your time.\nLevel 130-131 - \u0026#34;Success is everything\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 1\u0026#34; Level 130-132 - \u0026#34;Front Lines\u0026#34; Level 132-134 - \u0026#34;The Predator Leader\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 2\u0026#34; Level 134-135 - \u0026#34;The Final Ingredient\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 3\u0026#34; Final Note: The 135 reps are very slow. Focus on your dailies and KQS and complete any quests you haven\u0026#39;t done those far (aside from those your dropping for) to help move things a bit faster.\n","description":"Bone-fide adventurers are characters leveling from 121-135, these are their stories","id":3,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Bone-fide Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/adventurer/"},{"content":" Hi hi 👋 You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 39 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over two years ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I was completely addicted 🤪 If I\u0026#39;m honest, Fiesta Online isn\u0026#39;t exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I\u0026#39;ve made friends and just can\u0026#39;t seem to leave them. So I\u0026#39;m still playing, even if I\u0026#39;m only slowly leveling one character 😅, and spending most of my time playing other games.\nOver the last year, I learned that I don\u0026#39;t really like playing Fiesta Online much. I\u0026#39;m still on every now and then, but I\u0026#39;d rather spend time on other games. However, I have also been a member of several guildes and picked up a few things from them, including some guides. If you\u0026#39;re looking for some help then check out those guides or just find me in game. I\u0026#39;d still be happy to help 😁\nThough Fiesta is the game play most consistently, I am occasionally on other games, including other MMOs. Some MMOs I like are Final Fantasy XIV, Tower of Fantasy, and Ys Online. Chances are, if you run into a character named Yayoi, YayoiChi, Yayoi Chi, or something similar than I\u0026#39;m playing her! MMOs aren\u0026#39;t all I play, I also play other online games like Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, and I\u0026#39;m a big fan of retro games, like Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers, and JRPGS, my favorite of which is the Xenosaga Saga and Persona series. In fact, I love these games so much, I\u0026#39;ve added some guides from them!\nAlso, I make a pretty good friend. If you happen to be on Steam, Mastodon, or Matrix, you can add me. I put links to my profiles on the bottom of the site. You can use these and the e-mail link to get in touch with suggestions or issues with the site as well, though a prefer to hear about page specific problems in their comments, thank you!\n","description":"My name is Yayoi and I love playing games. If you wanna learn more this is the page to do it!","id":4,"section":"","tags":["about"],"title":"Introduction","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/introduction/"},{"content":" I realized that, though there is a forum post too, a news article that just barely mentioned commissions was probably not enough to lay out all the information one might need to know to get started if they wanted to commission me. This page will rectify that. I will lay out what I am willing to draw, what I am not willing to draw, and how you can contact me if you are interested. I will also go over how I expect to be paid.\nWhat I am willing to draw First, I don\u0026#39;t mind expending my skills, so this is not an extensive list of everything I will draw. You can think of this more like a list of things I feel comfortable drawing. I\u0026#39;ll draw pretty much anything so long as its not in the list of things I won\u0026#39;t draw, but I am particularly good a few things things and those things are:\nCute girls! Yep I like drawing cute girls, if they are cute enough I might even draw fan-art. By the way, fan-art is legally questionable, I will not handle getting permission to draw other people\u0026#39;s characters, that\u0026#39;s up to you, and you must let me know you have permissions before I start! Character designs. Similar to the above I can design new characters for you. I will do my very best if that character is a guy, but I am very good with cute girls. If you don\u0026#39;t want cute though…probably should look elsewhere to be honest 😅. Still profile pictures. I can even make profile pictures, just don\u0026#39;t expect animations. Wallpapers, we\u0026#39;ll talk about that, but I am willing to try. Other backgrounds, and \u0026#34;cards\u0026#34;, these can be great for streamers. If you need a background to use while you stream, or if you need like a stand-by card, start card, or end card when you stream, contact me, I\u0026#39;ll do my best! Don\u0026#39;t forget that you can always reach out and let me know you are interested, and I\u0026#39;ll decide if I think I can do a good job and we\u0026#39;ll discuss things further, as long as your idea doesn\u0026#39;t fall into the categories of things I am not willing to draw below!\nWhat I am not willing to draw This is a bit more straightforward and there isn\u0026#39;t much negotiating on anything here. Sure, you can always talk about it, but there isn\u0026#39;t much chance I will work on a commissions on any of these topics!\nViolence, I am against my characters getting hurt and will likely not wish this on any other characters. Still, violence can happen and mild violence is usually okay, but anything too extreme and I won\u0026#39;t draw it, that\u0026#39;s that! Gore. Yep not touching that at all. Anything too gory and that\u0026#39;s a complete no-go. If I even get a whiff of it then I\u0026#39;ll stop you right there! Sexual content. Yeah I don\u0026#39;t draw Hentai, no exceptions. Also if it involves a certain male body part at all, then…yeah not going to happen. Light romance and some questionable things may make it if you ask nicely Anything that targets or marginalizes any group of people regardless of how large or small that groups is. This includes anything that targets racial stereotypes, stereotypes involving one\u0026#39;s sexual orientation or gender identity, or any hate toward anyone! Political party logos or anything that could be interpreted as my endorsement of any political group. Sorry just not going there! How to contact me if you are interested in a commission The best bet is to contact me via the forums post I have set up for this exact purpose, however, the forum does require registration and I understand that there may be some who do not want yet another account they have to remember. For that reason I have several other methods you can use. For example, if you have a GitHub account already, you can use the Utterance box below to single your interest in a commission. I\u0026#39;ll try to keep things going through GitHub, but may need another e-mail. You can skip that by just e-mailing me directly. Finally, if none of these suit you, check out my Steam, Mastodon, or Matrix accounts at the bottom of these and every page. We\u0026#39;ll discuss things over the DMs there! Whatever is most comfortable for you.\nHow will you pay me? At this time all pricing will be discussed before I start your commission. Once we have decided on a price you are willing to pay, I will send you a payment link for $50 dollars. This is a deposit and it is not refundable. Once you pay that, I will begin work. Depending on how we establish payments you may receive other payment links or one final link for the full price after work is completed. You will be expected to pay that link before the final commission is delivered to you.\nAll payment is processed through Stripe. Stripe is a third-party payment processor. This is done to ensure protection for both you, as the client, and myself, as the artist. If you have any further questions on payment, we can discuss them, but no other payment processor will be accepted and I do not accept cash, check, or money order.\n","description":"This page lays out what I can do for you as well as basic expectations I have if you want to commission me to draw for you.","id":5,"section":"","tags":["about"],"title":"About Commissions","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/commissions/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep,\nIt\u0026#39;s been another week and with another week another update. This time I am pleased to announce that I am releasing the first episode of a multi-part series of short stories that I am calling RE[BASE]. I\u0026#39;ve been spending most of my time working on this story and some art relating to it. Mostly trying to get character designs done. I\u0026#39;m also working on a secret project, shh, don\u0026#39;t tell anyone.\nCelebration time 🥳 My friend, and first client, has just reached affiliate on Twitch! Actually, I am watching them stream as I\u0026#39;m writing this. They are also about to reach 100 followers and its been great cheering them on. Of course it is also great seeing my art on every stream. My little Jade is really getting out there! If you have some time why not hop over to Jade\u0026#39;s twitch page and give them a follow. If I\u0026#39;m lucky they\u0026#39;ll be able to commission me some more with a few more subscribers or followers, so do check them out!\nDrawing for other people While I have also spent time working on some of my own projects, mostly just designing new characters for RE[BASE], I find it far more interesting and easier to draw for other people. I don\u0026#39;t know if I get some sort of reward from it, or what, but I do like it. In fact I\u0026#39;m working on a bit of a surprise for someone. They aren\u0026#39;t even paying me and I enjoy it far more than working on anything I started for myself. I think this is why I really want more commissions.\nRE[BASE] Update RE[BASE] Episode 1 is officially out today! I have also started the second episode and it should be out next week. I\u0026#39;m not sure if I\u0026#39;m going to be able to release an episode every week, but I\u0026#39;ll try at least during break. Should be you\u0026#39;ll have three episodes up to read just in case things slow down during my next quarter.\nOf course, the short stories aren\u0026#39;t all I plan on releasing. I am designing the characters too and you\u0026#39;ll see them in my peektures, but I am also hoping to illustrate parts of the story. For this I would like to incorporate them in the actual story, maybe one at the beginning and a few peppered in between paragraphs. Not really sure how I\u0026#39;ll do it just yet, but you\u0026#39;ll see as they come out. As I mentioned last week, I won\u0026#39;t be waiting for these illustrations to release episodes, but its likely that they will come out fairly frequently during the next quarter. It is usually easier for me to find time to draw than write. Just check back old episodes every now-and-then to see new art.\nIf you have any comments on the story, don\u0026#39;t hesitate to let me know. You can comment on the pages themselves, or use any of the links at the bottom to reach me, including the forum. Thank you! Hope you enjoy the new story!\n","description":"","id":6,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","rebase","allana"],"title":"RE[BASE] is Up!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-09-28/"},{"content":" During my break I decided to do some productive things instead of just playing video games. I mean I do that too, but not just that 😝 One of those new things is getting back in to creative writing. While this week\u0026#39;s update likely won\u0026#39;t feature it, I have started a new series of short stories. Of course I\u0026#39;m also now about halfway through Persona 4 Golden so I\u0026#39;ve been updating my guide for that finally!\nMore progress means beeger walkthrough! First, I have made more progress in Persona 4 Golden. I\u0026#39;ve gotten through July and the beginning of August. I believe this will put me around the halfway mark as I believe the game goes through one full calendar year. Now I am not really focusing on quests at the moment, so that part of the guide is still not there, I am also only focusing on some club activities and jobs, so the social link guides will also come later. Okay, if I\u0026#39;m honest, right now, all that I have been working on is the general walkthrough. I am working on Nanako\u0026#39;s Social Link as well, but have reached a bit of a snag due to early game laziness. Once I\u0026#39;m able to progress, I think I\u0026#39;ll write a bit on that so that people can avoid the mistakes I made and, I\u0026#39;ll hopefully get more information up on other social links and clubs and jobs and how to combine the two. For now though, enjoy the walkthrough. I\u0026#39;ll probably have to break it up at some point as it is getting to be pretty long, but I\u0026#39;ll worry about that later 😅\nNew ADVENTURE! I am actually using Hugo\u0026#39;s draft capabilities! Normally, I just leave the draft variable set to false because I write and proofread new guide additions, peektures, and news articles within the week. This means that most new additions are finished before the next update. This doesn\u0026#39;t seem to be the case for my stories though. They\u0026#39;ll take a little longer, so I have set the first one to draft and it won\u0026#39;t show up just yet. I\u0026#39;ll give you a bit of a sneakpeek though.\nRE[BASE] The new ADVENTURE is called RE[BASE] and will follow the cute adventures of a thirteen year-old girl named Allana who is an avid gamer. For reasons that will be explained in the story, Allana now spends most of her time at home with her sister, Trista, playing MMO\u0026#39;s and chatting to friends on Discord. Occasionally her friends come over to hang out and antics ensue. It\u0026#39;s meant to be a kind of \u0026#34;slice of life\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;cute girls doing cute things\u0026#34; kind of story that takes my quarantine experience from when I had COVID as well as the experience of what it was like when COVID first started and blows it up.\nRE[BASE]/Format While there is an overarching story, and some potential pitfalls and plot twists. Each episode will be designed as a short story with self-contained plots. I\u0026#39;m doing this because I noticed that I tend to give up pretty early in my stories, so I\u0026#39;m hoping a series of short stories would be more manageable, plus, if I don\u0026#39;t get to certain parts, it\u0026#39;ll be okay because you could just enjoy the individual little stories.\nRE[BASE]/Pictures Though I will be changing draft to false as soon as a story is completed, ensuring availability as soon as I publish the next week\u0026#39;s updates, I plan on illustrating parts of the story. These illustrations will be added as they are completed. I don\u0026#39;t want to hold back a story because I\u0026#39;m waiting to finish a drawing. Please keep checking back, and checking my galleries, so you don\u0026#39;t miss the illustrations!\nBreak I have completed my first residency and am currently on break! 🥳 I\u0026#39;ve been using my time for writing, playing video games, and watching anime. Its been nice to have the time to work on hobbies. Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll throw some drawing in there too before break is over. Not looking forward to my next class, but I\u0026#39;m hoping to do well. Look forward to new art, new stories, and more updates to guides over the next couple of weeks!\n","description":"","id":7,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"New ADVENTURE Series!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-09-21/"},{"content":" This is an original story. The story is written in first person, please note that the thoughts and feelings expressed in this story are those of the character, Allana, and not those of the author, Yayoi. Thank you!\nAbout Me Hello everyone! I was in Discord not too long ago with a friend of mine. He\u0026#39;s a programmer and said he worked on one of my favorite massively multiplayer online role-playing games, oh god, spelling all that out is rough, no wonder we usually just say MMORPG, anyway, he said the first thing he learns how to do when he learns a new programming language is print \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;. He said it is different and sometimes it isn\u0026#39;t even something you print to a user\u0026#39;s screen, not even sure how it would work when learning to build a video game, but I like it! So instead of \u0026#34;Hello everyone!\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;ll change it to Hello world!\nHello world! My name is Allana, I am thirteen years old and I used to spend time outside of school just playing video games. I know, so weird for a girl, right? I mean what self-respecting teenage girl would just go to school, barely talk to anyone, then come home and spend the rest of her day playing video games? Like no one right?\nWell, I do! I guess I should explain a few things about me before we go on. I mean, you\u0026#39;re going to be getting to know a lot about me, I think. I mean that\u0026#39;s the plan. Its the whole reason I\u0026#39;m writing this. So here, we go! I am, how did Tabitha put it, adorably shy. I don\u0026#39;t like to talk to anyone except my sister, that\u0026#39;s Tabitha, and maybe a couple of people in class, Momo is kind of nice and very understanding and cute and I should probably move on before this whole thing ends up all about Momo. Anyway, when I am called on, I shuffle in my seat awkwardly and try to talk until the teacher calls on someone else. I\u0026#39;m not stupid, and it isn\u0026#39;t just Momo and Tabitha that say that, I just can\u0026#39;t handle other people. Because I\u0026#39;m like that, anyone who approaches me to talk, even if they are just asking how my weekend was, ends up with the same mumbling mess the teacher gets and usually Momo steps in. To be honest, I\u0026#39;m not really sure how I ended up friends with Momo. I do remember when we first met. It was back in elementary school…\nHello Momo! There I was that one fateful day at the beginning of fall quarter. I had just entered the fourth grade and was gearing up for another year of stammering and stumbling and awkwardly trying to make it through each day. Little did I know, this would be a far more awkward day then I have ever experienced.\nFirst, when I sat down I just about slid right out of my chair. I manged to catch myself before my bum hit the floor, but not before my brand new skirt caught the edge of the chair and was just about yanked straight up. I stood quickly and straightened by skirt, but now everyone was staring at me. I blushed and sat down almost as quickly as I stood up. I put my head between my arms, on my desk, and closed my eyes hoping I would soon no longer feel the burning gaze of my classmates on my back.\nJust as I was beginning to feel comfortable, I heard something. \u0026#34;Allana,\u0026#34; it was faint but familiar, \u0026#34;Allana!\u0026#34; Was someone saying my name? \u0026#34;ALLANA!!\u0026#34; My head shot up. The teacher had been calling me. He shook his head. \u0026#34;Come to the board and solve this problem!\u0026#34; It was probably my worst nightmare. In third grade me and my teacher had an understanding, if she didn\u0026#39;t call on me during class, I would stay late each day and help her clean up. Actually, I liked my third grade teacher, she was very nice, and would even let me help her grade quizzes and look over lesson plans. Of course, I was in fourth grade now, and had a completely different teacher. I think this was even his first year at this school.\nI slowly stood up, with shaking legs, and tried to make my way to the front of the class. I kept my head down so I wouldn\u0026#39;t see the faces of my classmates. If I couldn\u0026#39;t see them then maybe, just maybe, they would all disappear and this would be easier. Of course, that isn\u0026#39;t how things worked and my heart just kept racing faster and faster until I got to the board. My eyes couldn\u0026#39;t even focus on what was written. \u0026#34;Teach!\u0026#34; someone called.\n\u0026#34;No one help her!\u0026#34; the teacher, obviously angry, he probably thought I was sleeping, shouted.\n\u0026#34;Dude, you stupid something?\u0026#34; the voice continued. At first I thought it was talking about me and I was just about ready to cry, but something really unexpected happened.\n\u0026#34;Excuse me!?\u0026#34; the teacher asked, even more enraged.\n\u0026#34;Do you have any idea who you just called up?\u0026#34; the voice continued. The teacher, either shocked by the student\u0026#39;s blatant disrespect, or just unsure about the question, remained quite. \u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s Allana, she never comes up to the board, and I mean never. Hell you\u0026#39;re lucky she made it this far. If I were you I\u0026#39;d have her go sit right back down before we have to get the nurse.\u0026#34;\nThe voice was probably referring to another time I was called up at the end of second grade. I had collapsed and woke up in the nurse\u0026#39;s office. Guess they were worried that would happen again. Maybe they even thought that\u0026#39;s why I was never up in third grade. \u0026#34;Listen!\u0026#34; The teacher shouted \u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t appreciate my students telling me how to teach. You will ALL sit quietly and wait for her to finish the problem!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Hell, its your funeral, but won\u0026#39;t you look like just the worst teacher if she does pass out. You think we\u0026#39;ll have any respect left you then?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;First, watch you language! Second, if you\u0026#39;re so worried, why don\u0026#39;t you come up and solve it for her then!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Fine!\u0026#34; the voice replied. Next thing I knew I was on my way back to my seat and another girl was up at the bored. She made a complete mess of trying to solve a math problem, but at least I wasn\u0026#39;t up there any more. Only things weren\u0026#39;t quite over.\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s utterly wrong,\u0026#34; the teacher said. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll see both of you after class.\u0026#34; The girl dropped the chalk and stomped back to her seat.\nI tried to sneak away after class, but the girl came right up to my desk just before I stood up. \u0026#34;Where do you think your going?\u0026#34; she questioned.\n\u0026#34;I-I-\u0026#34; I started.\n\u0026#34;Relax, I\u0026#39;m just messing with you.\u0026#34; The girl said. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m Momo.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;A-A-\u0026#34; I tried to tell her my name, but it kept getting stuck.\n\u0026#34;Allana,\u0026#34; I know. \u0026#34;I transferred in last year. Heard a bit about you. Some people think your the most stuck up bitch in class, oh oops. Sorry my mom is always threatening to wash my mouth out.\u0026#34; The girl place her hand on the back of her head and tried to look embarrassed, \u0026#34;Umm.. anyway I didn\u0026#39;t believe them. You seem very sweet, if not a little shy.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Are you two delinquents finished introducing yourselves?\u0026#34; someone asked.\n\u0026#34;Not yet, but go ahead teach, you want to chew someone out, you got me! You can let Allana go home!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re ten, you better learn how to respect your elders.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Yeah, yeah,\u0026#34; said Momo, \u0026#34;I heard that before. You going to let Allana go home or what?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Allana!\u0026#34; the man began. \u0026#34;Were you sleeping in class?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Dude, what is your deal!?\u0026#34; Momo asked. \u0026#34;Just let it go, she wasn\u0026#39;t sleeping in class.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m sure she can speak for herself!\u0026#34; the teacher exclaimed.\n\u0026#34;Are you!?\u0026#34; Momo shouted. \u0026#34;Do you even know her? Seems like you\u0026#39;re making a lot of assumptions and do you know what that makes you?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;If you say it, I\u0026#39;ll send you straight to…\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;The principle\u0026#39;s office? Yeah me and him are very close. Listen, Allana is shy, not a delinquent, so just learn more about people before you judge them. I\u0026#39;ll see myself to the principle, but I\u0026#39;ll also be more than happy to tell him all about what you\u0026#39;re doing to Allana, in graphic detail, if you know what I mean.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Fine! Allana, you can go home.\u0026#34; I wasn\u0026#39;t sure what exactly Momo was implying when she said that or how it got him to change his attitude so quickly, but I was glad it was all over.\nJust before we parted ways, I did something I never thought I\u0026#39;d do to anyone but Tabitha. I threw my arms around Momo, \u0026#34;Thank you,\u0026#34; I whispered in her ear as clearly as I\u0026#39;m writing this now. It was the first time I said anything without stumbling that wasn\u0026#39;t directed at my sister.\n\u0026#34;Hey,\u0026#34; Momo said, \u0026#34;any time.\u0026#34; I think I held on a bit too long, because she soon started squirming. I let go but we\u0026#39;ve been nearly inseparable sense.\nI don\u0026#39;t if Momo had said something to that teacher or to the principle about him, or what happened after that day. All I know, is I was never called on again that entire year.\nSorry, I know I said this wasn\u0026#39;t going to be all about Momo. Guess I was wrong. Momo and I are just very close, so I can\u0026#39;t help but write about her a lot.\n","description":"","id":8,"section":"adventures","tags":["original","adventure","allana","rebase","momo"],"title":"RE[BASE] Allana: Hello World!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/fiction/rebase/allana_ep1/"},{"content":" Hello!\nI come bearing some bad news. There will be no content update this week. I am, as you can read, still writing a news article, but there will be no further updates. I am pleased enough that I have not forgotten the site for several weeks straight now. I still count this week since you are seeing this. Maybe I should start putting a counter in 😆 Just kidding, I think that would change my mindset and I would end up breaking the streak and then saying \u0026#34;Why can\u0026#39;t I keep it going!?\u0026#34; and get all depressed, so I won\u0026#39;t do that. I\u0026#39;ll just continue to be happy that I make an effort every week to at least post a news article!\nSleeping Habits! Yep I\u0026#39;m just going to jump over here without a single transition sentence cuz, weee, it\u0026#39;s fun! So sleeping habits, mine suck! I don\u0026#39;t know why. I think sleep is important and I know I feel much better when I get at least seven hours of actual sleep, not just laying in bed. I even went through the trouble of getting an Apple Watch SE so I could track my sleep more accurately. Guess what? It works! But, remember that sentence in the other paragraph about me saying \u0026#34;Why can\u0026#39;t I keep it going!?\u0026#34; Well, that applies to my sleep too.\nWhen I was working part time and going to doctoral-level classes at full time (I don\u0026#39;t suggest doing that, especially if your part time job is very demanding and you end up with almost full time hours), I always said, oh I am working to much, that\u0026#39;s why I\u0026#39;m not getting enough sleep. So I quit my job and everything worked out. All done! I get good girl head pats now, right? Wrong!\nOh, I was doing suuuper good for awhile. Yep always getting at least seven and a half hours of sleep and feeling great. Went from needing a energy drink in the middle of the day to not needing anything. Unfortunately, it didn\u0026#39;t last. At some point I noticed that, although I was getting enough sleep, and it felt great not waking up to an alarm, I was starting to get up later and later. I totally didn\u0026#39;t want to be one of those who didn\u0026#39;t wake up until noon, even if my school schedule would allow it. So I threatened to set myself an alarm again. Now I have been waking up no later than eight, which is kind of good, except for the fact that I have been getting less than seven hours and feeling sluggish and needing energy drinks again 😔 Now I feel dejected because I am not getting enough sleep and asking \u0026#34;Why can\u0026#39;t I keep it going!?\u0026#34; again. This time with no answer. Actually, I\u0026#39;d say, because I played over three hours of Holocure and didn\u0026#39;t get to bed until one, I\u0026#39;d say that, except that was last night and I actually was only minutes from my goal that night. Anyway, I\u0026#39;ll try to do better, but that is not why there is no content updates this week 😝\nSignature Assignment At the beginning of this quarter I started my first of three virtual residencies to prepare for my doctoral dissertation. This has been an interesting course and has helped me a lot in settling on a actionable research topic for my dissertation. In the course of this course I have done a lot of research, to the point that, I think I know just about everything you can know about one specific topic 😆 I also did a lot of writing. This week has been, and continues to be, very busy as it is the last week of this residency. That means I have a signature assignment due that goes over the particulars of my topic and outlines the research I plan on doing. At the time I\u0026#39;m writing this, it is about 77% done. Just a few finishing touches, really. I have spent my week on it though. This is the main reason there is no content updates this week.\nHow About Next Week? Well, there is a big chance there will be more content updates next week. I have an idea for another short story that I would like to write and, as I said, this is the last week of my first residency. I get a short break between this and my next course, so I\u0026#39;ll have time to work on more creative things. Maybe I\u0026#39;ll also finish another drawing. Either way you\u0026#39;ll have some thing to look forward to next week. For now, I hope you are satisfied with this one, rather long, news article!\n","description":"","id":9,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Busy Week","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-09-14/"},{"content":" Well, as of writing this I am still technically writing a thing. I started it thought so, yeah…😆 Anyway, aside from writing a new ADVENTURE, I also made a few more adjustments to my fiesta leveling guide. This week though it is mostly about writing!\nAbout the adjustments After racking my brain for a bit and looking at some Hugo documentation and found a way to re-order the list for the individual leveling guides. It seemed like all the guides were kind of just in whatever order they were created or something and that made it a bit difficult for me to find the write guide. They should all be in the right order though. Babies on top all the way to God-like Adventurer\u0026#39;s at the bottom. Of course the level range for each guide is still available in its description so you\u0026#39;ll know which guide to open based on what level your characters are.\nOnce a guide is open you can use the list on the side to find your level and find what rep or set of quests to do. Speaking of this, back when I wrote the guides in Markdown, I started all the headers at a second level so the title of the page could be the first. This is not needed anymore because the Hugo template handles that. I finally went through and adjusted all the headers so they are correct now.\nFinally, I made a noted on the fledgling adventure guide that you can still do gargoyles up until 91 and even gave a strategy on doing both RS and gargoyles at the same time, if you want. Personally I found it difficult, but that was probably because I was juggling the quest and killing at the same time. If you have a friend to keel for you, it will probably work out better.\nNew ADVENTURE Technically, as of right now, I am still writing this, but I wanted to go ahead and talk about it now. It should be available the same time this news articles goes up anyway. I was inspired by my friends and the changing of the seasons so I wrote (or am writing) a little short story about BabyYayo, one of my Fiesta characters. She going back to school. I hope you like it. If you have a GitHub account, don\u0026#39;t hesitate to comment on it! If you don\u0026#39;t have a GitHub account you can still let me know through my socials linked at the bottom of this page! Now I am going to head over and finished hat story! Gotta make sure it goes up with this article after all 😄\n","description":"","id":10,"section":"news","tags":[],"title":"I wrote a thing!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-09-07/"},{"content":" BabyYayo and Yayoi_chi sit on the beach at Sand Beach. They look out at the sun. Yayoi_chi can already tell that the days are getting shorter, but the pair sit in silence, wearing their kimono hoping to catch a glance of fireworks. Even with the shorter days, it is still far too early. \u0026#34;The days are really getting shorter, huh?\u0026#34; Baby asks, breaking the silence like a distant wave.\nYayoi_chi stretches an arm around her younger sister. She draws her in close, like a mother bird protecting her child. \u0026#34;The are,\u0026#34; she says almost dreamily, wondering when Baby will grow too old for this kind of embrace and hoping it isn\u0026#39;t too soon. Then a devious smile flashes over Yayoi\u0026#39;s lips \u0026#34;You know what that means, right?\u0026#34; she asks.\n\u0026#34;No,\u0026#34; Baby looks into her sister\u0026#39;s eyes trying to figure out what she was thinking all of a sudden.\nYayoi\u0026#39;s smile turn to a rather frightening grin. \u0026#34;Its time for you to go back to school!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I guess,\u0026#34; Baby said, still unsure of her sister\u0026#39;s intentions.\nYayoi grabbed her sister\u0026#39;s hands forcefully! \u0026#34;Time to get you ready!\u0026#34;\nIt donned on Baby just what her sister had planned for her, and she wasn\u0026#39;t entirely sure she liked it!\nYayoi\u0026#39;s devious plot! Before Baby was even sure what was happening she was on her feet and heading away from the beach. She looked back longingly \u0026#34;But what about the fireworks,\u0026#34; she said quietly. If her sister heard her, she certainly didn\u0026#39;t listen, because the pair were soon on their little matching Chirpys and headed back to Roumen.\n\u0026#34;School supplies, school supplies,\u0026#34; Yayoi breathed as she literally dragged her sister by the hand through the upper road of Roumen, \u0026#34;Who would sell school supplies?\u0026#34; In the distance she spotted Skill Master Ruby. \u0026#34;Surely a skill master would know something about school supplies!\u0026#34; she thought aloud.\nYayoi dragged her sister over to the skill master. \u0026#34;Oh hi there sweeties,\u0026#34; the master greeted. She still remember selling skill scrolls to Yayoi_chi back when she was younger, as well as selling some to Baby. \u0026#34;My Baby, you have grown!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What about me?\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi asked. For the longest time, it seemed she was stuck in her training, but, recently, she felt she had grown quite a bit as an ADVENTURER.\n\u0026#34;You too, darling,\u0026#34; Ruby added. Yayoi proudly placed her hands on her hips. \u0026#34;What can I do for you today? Surely you two have both outgrown my little shoppe!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know about that,\u0026#34; Yayoi said, trying to sound bashful, \u0026#34;but, you\u0026#39;re right, we aren\u0026#39;t here for skill scrolls. You see its time for Baby here to go back to school!\u0026#34;\nNot missing a beat, Ruby replied, \u0026#34;Congrats, dear, but what can I help you with?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I know it\u0026#39;s probably beneath a merchant of your stature to sell little things like school supplies, but I was wondering if you knew someone who did.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;As a matter of fact I…\u0026#34; Ruby started, \u0026#34;do not, but I hear the blacksmith might at least know where you could get her a uniform. That\u0026#39;s a start, no?\u0026#34;\nBabyYayo didn\u0026#39;t mind being dragged over to Ruby. She had learned a lot thanks to Ruby\u0026#39;s skill scrolls and Ruby was always nice to her. She especially liked how Ruby called her \u0026#34;sweetie\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;darling\u0026#34;. It really made her feel special somehow, even though she did that with just about everyone, at least as far as Baby was aware. The black smith, however, that was another story. Sure Baby got a lot of her gear from him, but never really liked dealing with him. She hid behind her sister as she asked, \u0026#34;So, I hear you have some information on where every student is getting their uniforms these days.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;And what if I do?\u0026#34; the man asked.\n\u0026#34;Well,\u0026#34; Yayoi said with a wink and a grin, \u0026#34;I might be able to make it worth your while if you told me.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Oh, come on now, we all know you\u0026#39;re broke,\u0026#34; the man said.\n\u0026#34;Hey!\u0026#34; Yayoi exclaimed. \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ll have you know I am not broke! I\u0026#39;m just saving a few gems for a rainy day!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Have you ever seen a drop of rain here lassy?\u0026#34; the grizzled black smith questioned.\n\u0026#34;No, but that doesn\u0026#39;t matter, it could rain!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Sure…\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Well, I can make it worth your while, so are you going to tell me where I can get my sister a uniform?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Your sister? Oh, is this for the cutey behind you? Why didn\u0026#39;t you say so? But I don\u0026#39;t exactly know where you can buy her a uniform.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;But…\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I said I didn\u0026#39;t know exactly, but I can give you an idea.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay?\u0026#34; Yayoi prompted.\n\u0026#34;Two letter, A and R\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;AR, what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u0026#34; Yayoi asked. The blacksmith made a motion like he was a mime zipping is lips closed. \u0026#34;Fine, don\u0026#39;t tell me! Come on, Baby, we\u0026#39;re leaving!\u0026#34; Baby couldn\u0026#39;t say she was sad to go. The man was still giving her a creepy look.\nYayoi\u0026#39;s surprise! \u0026#34;Abestol Ruins,\u0026#34; Baby suddenly called out as Yayoi dragged her toward the teleport gate in Roumen.\n\u0026#34;What?\u0026#34; Yayoi asked.\n\u0026#34;A and R,\u0026#34; Baby explained, \u0026#34;A is Abestol and R is Ruins!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What a smart sister I have!\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi exclaimed. She set their destination for Abestol Ruins and soon they were in the small village. \u0026#34;But don\u0026#39;t think this means you get to skip school!\u0026#34; the girl added. Baby sighed, it seemed that even her adventuring wouldn\u0026#39;t save her from school. Of course, she knew all to well just how stubborn her sister could be.\nAfter asking around for a bit, the pair finally found where to pick up a uniform and school supplies. Baby was feeling very encumbered as she carried all of the new supplies in the few bags she had. As she tried to juggle have everything, her sister took her by the shoulder. \u0026#34;I have a surprise,\u0026#34; she said with a wink. What now? Baby wondered.\nYayoi_chi stopped by the storage keeper. She let go of her sister\u0026#39;s hands. \u0026#34;Wait here,\u0026#34; she said with another wink. Baby let out a sigh and watched as her sister chatted with the storage keeper for a few minutes. Fortunately, she was gone too long. \u0026#34;All set,\u0026#34; the older sister said, \u0026#34;let\u0026#39;s get you into your uniform.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What!?\u0026#34; BabyYayo complained, \u0026#34;Now!?\u0026#34; Yayoi nodded while she pushed her sister off into one of the nearby buildings. She found a quiet room and handed her younger sister the uniform they just purchased.\nDid you think I\u0026#39;d make you go alone? BabyYayo put on the uniform and stepped out of the private room her sister had found. She expected to see her sister, but Yayoi_chi was no where to be seen. \u0026#34;Did she leave me here?\u0026#34; the girl asked. She plopped herself on a nearby bench, only to stand right back up at the slightest sound of a door opening. It was her sister and she was also wearing a school uniform. \u0026#34;Oneechan!\u0026#34; Baby called.\n\u0026#34;I never said you\u0026#39;d be going to school alone,\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi stated.\n\u0026#34;Oneechan,\u0026#34; Baby said with a smile.\n\u0026#34;Now we can be partners in school ADVENTURES!\u0026#34; Yayoi_chi proclaimed.\n\u0026#34;Onee~~chan!!\u0026#34; Baby shouted!\n-Fin-\n","description":"","id":11,"section":"adventures","tags":[],"title":"Baby Goes Back 2 School","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/baby-back2school/"},{"content":" This was originally going to be called, \u0026#34;More about commission\u0026#34;, but I didn\u0026#39;t want to confuse anyone especially since the site ordered this right below the actual about commissions page. This is this week\u0026#39;s news article not just another section talking about commissions. I mean that was one thing I added though this week though!\nI want commissions! Yeah, so commissions are actually kind of fun for me. They give me an excuse to draw and I get paid so win-win maybe. Anyway, I know I mentioned them a little bit in the last news article, but I felt that I didn\u0026#39;t really give them enough attention, so I added a dedicated page that talks about them in a bit more detail. This includes things I feel I\u0026#39;m good at and am more than willing to draw for you as well as things I absolutely won\u0026#39;t draw. I also go into more detail on how to get a hold of me and how payments are likely to work. This was only one addition though.\nNew gallery section! I decided that it would be best to showcase commissions that I have permission to showcase sperately from other art work of mine. For that reason, I created a new gallery section for commissions specifically. I know that\u0026#39;s a LOT of commisssion-related things, but I really like doing them!\nMore Fiesta stuff I\u0026#39;ve been playing a lot more Fiesta Online. I haven\u0026#39;t discovered anything odd about my guide since the last time, but I\u0026#39;m keeping my eyes opened. So far it hasn\u0026#39;t really inspired any new ADVENTURES either. Mostly I\u0026#39;ve just be leveling BabyYayo, my younger character. That gets a bit reptitive, but I\u0026#39;m hoping to have some ADVENTURES with her soon. I\u0026#39;ll keep you all posted.\nI have a fleet! Also I\u0026#39;ve been playing \u0026#34;No Man\u0026#39;s Sky\u0026#34; still. I\u0026#39;m actually surprpised. I mean I go over a lot of my surprises about the game itself it my firt impressions, but I\u0026#39;m also surprised that I\u0026#39;m playing two games at once still. I tend to drop old games whenever I start something new. As I mentioned though I have a fleet now and am really enjoying that aspect of the game. I\u0026#39;ll write more about that when I put together a full review later.\nThe streak continues Honestly, I wasn\u0026#39;t sure what I would say or do for the site this week until last night. I was worried I\u0026#39;d break my streak, but, as you can see, I have not. Hopefully I keep this site alive!

As I said, I am planning on writing a full review once I have completed the main story missions, but I didn\u0026#39;t want to wait that long because I really like the game!\nAbout Commissions! After the success of my last commission, I have decided that I would like to do more of them. Once again I have to thank my friend for giving me the opportunity to work on commission. I have a forum post up where you can let me know you are interested in a commission. We can even start work shopping the idea in that thread or I\u0026#39;ll DM you.

I wanted to, once again, say that these are just the first impressions, but I did put a star ranking up. I will write a full review when I have completed the main missions, but I\u0026#39;ll leave up my first impressions too. I think it would be really good to be able to compare how my thoughts change, if they do, when I finish the main story. As always you can comment on my review using either the comment box on the page or a forum post.\nThis is intentionally blank I kid, sort of. Normally I have three heading in each news article, but I didn\u0026#39;t really come up with three things. Thought that would make a funny heading, but than I ruined it by explaining it, huh?

It is this last part that provides us with a surprisingly deep story that I was really not prepared for, but am pleasantly surprised is there!\nI\u0026#39;m going to start this off with a bit of a disclaimer. This page represents my first impressions of No Man\u0026#39;s Sky. I am, by no means, finished with the story.

There may be another page (one that will have the rating in the title like my other reviews) in the future that is more of a standard review, but on to my first impressions!\nOverall I am very impressed with the game so far. The visuals and art direction is great. The planets feel alive, if not a bit underwhelming in terms of diversity, and the gameplay is great! You are free to follow the story or just explore, or generally do whatever you want. You are hour own master and its pretty great. It reminds me of an MMO in this fashion. Which is probably why I like it so much. Of course being set in space and being able to explore all these new worlds is a real big bonus too even if the worlds to seem awfully close together.\nContent I can\u0026#39;t speak to the overall length of the game just yet and that might not matter. What I can say is that there does seem to be plenty of content available. There are tons of quests and side quests (or missions or whatever they like to call them here) and you pick up quite a few of the naturally just as you progress through the game. It can make it hard to prioritize things, but it also ensure you won\u0026#39;t be bored for quite a long time. I\u0026#39;m ten hours in already and can see I still have lots to do!.\nArt and Graphics This is both No Man\u0026#39;s Sky\u0026#39;s biggest strength and its weakness. The graphics and art direction are great. All the ships look good and look like they could actually exist, the stations are all kinda just spheres and the life forms are pretty interesting, but many planets seem to have only a couple of unique fauna, and that is a bummer. I understand that it may have been done to make exploring a bit less daunting, and may even be different for less \u0026#34;relaxed\u0026#34; players, but I do find myself wishing there were more types of animals as well as animals with fur, which I have yet to encounter. Also the seamless way you can change between space and planetary exploration is great, but also probably contributes to the overall small size of each star system. Still, its not terrible and at least I can understand why things were done the way they were.\nStory As I aluded to, this is where I was most impressed. Having heard about this game a long time ago, around when it was first announced, I figured it was just an open-ended exploration sandbox and, if it had a story, its story would be a low priority. I\u0026#39;ll say, this might have been the case back then, but it is not the case now. So far the story is very good and keeps me playing for….mayhap too long…each play session. I have said before, I play games for the story. I quickly abandon things, like Slime Rancher, if the story is short, or boring. No Man\u0026#39;s Sky is none of those so I keep on going!\n","description":"No Man's Sky is a surprisingly deep journey of exploration.

I did play a new game, but I\u0026#39;m not to a point where I\u0026#39;d feel comfortable reviewing it or writing a guide for it. This week wasn\u0026#39;t completely dead though. I have been spending some more time in Fiesta and that means some updates to the fiesta guide.\nMinor corrections So, I\u0026#39;ve been leveling one of my characters in Fiesta. This gives me a good opportunity to make sure my guide is still up-to-date as I often don\u0026#39;t remember some things and I have to have the guide up anyway while I play. I noticed some minor corrections needed to be made specifically in the fledgling adventurer leveling guide. So, the only real site update this week was fixing that guide. It is still important though!\nCommission Accomplished! This week I also finished my commission! I\u0026#39;m really excited and today I even got to see it in action on the client\u0026#39;s site. Oh, also I guess there was a couple other little updates! First I placed the commission in my creations gallery check it out there, please! I also added some new wallpapers!\nCheck out Twitch! My commission was for a vTuber we are calling Jade! This vTuber streams over on Twitch. They mostly play retro games, but check it out when you can. I\u0026#39;m actually watching them play FFX as I write this!\n","description":"Not much happened this week, but I did do a thing!","id":16,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","friends"],"title":"A little week","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-08-17/"},{"content":" I wrote another review. This review is about a game I played while I was playing Stray. I don\u0026#39;t normally play two games at once, but I actually managed to just this one time. As for other news, I\u0026#39;ve mostly just be working hard on commissions and other work. This means only small updates like this week\u0026#39;s updates, but I am still doing weekly updates so I think I\u0026#39;m doing fairly good!\nA little witch! Little Witch Nobeta is a very good game. It is plagued with some story issues, but I did enjoy it. I also enjoyed writing my review. I hope you enjoy reading it. Don\u0026#39;t really have much else to say, except Nobeta is suuuper kyuute! Okay I said it!\nWeekly updates Even if it is just new content like a new review and a new news article, I am still updating this site weekly. So far I\u0026#39;ve been able to keep my deadline three weeks in a row, even though it was a little difficult this week. My commission is coming a long and its a lot of fun to draw it. I mean how many other jobs to you get to watch YouTube while you work 😜. I also enjoy drawing and I think I\u0026#39;m doing even better then I would if I wasn\u0026#39;t working for someone else. It does take a lot of time and I am also still working at school so I was pretty busy this week, but I still managed and I hope to continue to manage my weekly updates for a long time!\n","description":"I wrote a thing!","id":17,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Moar Reviews!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-08-10/"},{"content":" \u0026nbsp; In Little Witch Nobeta you play as a little witch who lost her memory. She goes on a journey to the one place she remembers, a throne in a giant castle, in hopes of finding her memory. Along the way she meets a cat who is very insistent that she makes it to the throne!\nOverall If you like souls-like games and cute little girls, this game is for you! It isn\u0026#39;t just cute though there is a pretty nice, but somewhat predictable story and some pretty tough battles. Combat will get you if you aren\u0026#39;t prepared but there is one over-power spell that will likely carry you for most of the game as long as you remember it. This can be helpful but also makes the combat a bit…samey\nCombat At the beginning of the game combat can be a bit difficult and this game likes to through lots of enemies at you at once. With your first spell and only melee attacks it can get overwhelming. Fortunately, you start to feel very powerful pretty quickly as you gain spells and souls.\nPart of the fun of this game is upgrading your spells and your stats. As you upgrade these your begin to gain more and more power making you feel like a pretty awesome witch by the end of the game. Getting to that point can be challenging, but this challenge is also what makes this fun. You will be punished, but there will be a pay off.\nStory Honestly game play is great, combat is pretty awesome if not a bit challenging at first, the game is really fun, but it only has three stars, well, that\u0026#39;s because the story is…not so great. There is some interesting points, and I\u0026#39;ll admit I didn\u0026#39;t experience the entire story, but that\u0026#39;s part of the problem. Playing the game only gives you a part of the story. As you play you will again items, these items unlock little motion comics, but these can only be viewed once you complete the game and much of the story is locked in them. This makes for a pretty mediocre story during the game. Now, I mostly play games for the story so this might not be as important to others. It is something to be aware of though.\nStyle The style and art direction of the game is pretty nice. Nobeta and the other girls are very well designed and adorable. The game\u0026#39;s enemies are also nicely designed. Rooms and corridors are nice and there are some pretty cool areas. There is a little disconnect between all of these things though. It was almost like characters, maps, areas, and enemies were all designed by different people, yet it all does seem to work out pretty well in the end. Nobeta is cute and you\u0026#39;ll enjoy the game if you like her!\n","description":"Reviewing a cute game about a little loli witch that is cute!","id":18,"section":"reviews","tags":["review","cat","game","cute"],"title":"Little Witch Nobeta [3/5]","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/reviews/little-witch-nobeta/"},{"content":" Hello and welcome to another update!\nI like that I have time now to do more frequent updates to the site. This update is going to be a pretty small one. I have more time for sure, but not so much time that I can do big updates every time. I am trying to focus on good updates, so more frequent, but quality updates is what I\u0026#39;m trying to achieve. This week, there is no new review, but I plan on writing one for Little Witch Nobeta fairly soon as I just completed that game. I didn\u0026#39;t do everything, but I did finish the main story so I feel qualified to review it now. You can look forward to that review in next week\u0026#39;s update!\nA friend\u0026#39;s ADVENTURE For this week, we have a new ADVENTURE added to the ADVENTURES section only I didn\u0026#39;t write it. That\u0026#39;s right I got permission from a friend, michelle.bsparkx to use a story she had posted on Discord. I really like the story and thought it would be a good fit for my ADVENTURES, it even inspired to write more short-form stories. I was suuper glad she let me post a copy for everyone here. I hope you like it.\nA commission Yep, this week\u0026#39;s news is all friend-related 😆. A different friend of mine is planning on streaming soon and would like an avatar to use during their streams. They asked me to design the a vTuber and I have started that right away. I was really excited to get commissioned and want to do my best. I just hope they like what I come up with for them. I will not be posting all of the drawings I come up with here, but I will, with their permission of course, be posting some of the completed designs. I hope I do a good job, there is one thing I\u0026#39;m a little worried about though, but hopefully it will be fine 😅.\nSupport? I was asked if I would like financial compensation for the above commission, for me a commission is any request where I get some form of compensation and there are other forms than just money, but this did get me thinking, I don\u0026#39;t like taking money from people directly, but maybe I can take money through donations or something. What do you think? I\u0026#39;ve put a poll up in my forums. There you can answer and give me comments and reasons that support your answer, thank you for helping!\n","description":"I'm being commissioned to design a vTuber avatar!

An idea hatched to create a character by the name of _Egg.\nFast-forward to the present: _Egg is dancing by one of her favourite little Elderine friends, Marionette Edge. Their bright attire and colourful hair stand out amongst the crowd. A passerby asks about the runic aura that surrounds them. \u0026#34;I got it from a Kingdom Quest some years ago, but it\u0026#39;s no longer available. \u0026#34; solemnly responds _Egg, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ve heard it\u0026#39;s supposed to make its way back someday, though I\u0026#39;m not sure when.\u0026#34;\nAfter responding to their query, Edge and _Egg wander off to meet a stray pig on the outskirts of Elderine. _Egg runs up to hug the little piggie as Edge follows behind. They spend some time rolling around in the mud and enjoying the summer heat. \u0026#34;Look at you, all dirty! Maybe we should visit the beach to rinse off,\u0026#34; suggests Edge.\nThe two begin their hike past the Elderine guard spearmen, guard archers and through Forest of Mist, before reaching Sand Beach. They splash in the water, cleaning off and collecting starfish and clams. As they admire the push and pull of the ocean, they hear footsteps approaching. _Egg\u0026#39;s husband, _Toast, walks toward them with colourful heart-shaped balloons in hand.\n\u0026#34;Happy Birthday, my love! You\u0026#39;re so far from home it took me a while to find you,\u0026#34; exclaims _Toast, \u0026#34;Why don\u0026#39;t we head back and sit by the stadium to watch the sunset?\u0026#34; \u0026#34;I can make a picnic for us!\u0026#34; Suggests Edge excitedly.\nThe three make their way back to Elderine, stopping by a bed of flowers to admire their beauty. _Egg rarely finds her way outside the Elderine walls. She looks at her husband and her friend, soaking in the moment until they reach the front gates.\n\u0026#34;Home sweet home,\u0026#34; sighs _Egg. The trio walk to the stadium stairs and set up their picnic, enjoying the view of the town below them. They share stories and snacks as the sun sets, recounting their love for the town and its inhabitants. Perhaps tomorrow _Egg will go on another adventure, whether that be within the town walls standing next to people with descriptive names (_Egg enjoys \u0026#34;turning into\u0026#34; an _Egg McMuhffin, HardcoreFarmer _Egg, Sulking _Egg etc.) or outside the gates to face the merciless mobs, _Egg knows that her companions are good eggs and they\u0026#39;ll keep her safe.\n","description":"Yaya's Friend _Egg goes on a little adventure and gets a nice present","id":20,"section":"adventures","tags":["story","adventure","friend","_egg"],"title":"The Ultimate Yolk","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/adventures/friends/the-ultimate-yolk/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep,\nI have a couple new sections to announce! Well, its really a section and a sub-section. The first is a full section completely dedicated to reviews! The other is a sub-section of my adventures section that is dedicated to other adventures, or adventures that are of a more original nature!\nThe new section Reviews is best seeing as a logical extension of my guides section, but it is also broad enough to warrant its own section, in my opinion. It will be a collection of reviews, primarily of games that I\u0026#39;ve played, that I hope will help you decide if you would like to play them. The reviews will have different headings with relating to the strengths and weaknesses of that game and, guess what? The first review is already up!\nNow I\u0026#39;m not saying that my opinion should be bible or that it is even perfect, but its mine and I hope it will be one voice that will help you decide if you want to give your time and/or money to play the game. Keep in mind that I am a story-driven player. I play games mostly for the story, so this will be a strong draw for me in deciding if a game is worth my time. That said, graphics and gameplay are also important and will be considered.\nThe new sub-section You already get to see some of my art, and now you might just be able to read more of my original stories. The new sub-section, other adventures will collect some of these stories for you to read. Please read them if you want. I\u0026#39;m just putting them out there. I\u0026#39;m not saying I\u0026#39;m a good writer or anything, but maybe, just maybe I\u0026#39;ll be a good storyteller at least.\nThe forums! Going along with this release, I plan on adding threads to the my forums for my original adventures so you can comment on them if you\u0026#39;d like. I will also be adding a new forum for the reviews section and adding threads for my reviews. You can, of course, still comment on these using the comment box, but I\u0026#39;m hoping the forum threads can be used for my in-depth discussions.\n","description":"Say hello to the other adventures and reviews sections!","id":21,"section":"news","tags":["site","forum","news"],"title":"A new section and a new sub-section","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-07-25/"},{"content":" \u0026nbsp; Stray, what can I say about Stray? Stray starts with you immediately taking control of an adorable little tabby cat as he explorers the world with his liter-mates. This serves as an excellent why for you to learn the game, as well as a prologue for the story. The story quickly turns and things get very interesting very quick. The story was definitely not what I was expecting.\nOverall Overall the game is not bad. Controls are fairly easy if not a big finicky sometimes the graphics are nice and you can tell there was a lot of attention-to-detail where comes to the cat and its movements and mannerisms. The story is also very interesting even if it is a bit unexpected. The game, however, is also very short. I completed the game in less than 10 hours.\nLength As I mentioned, I completed the game in under 10 hours and there is even an achievement available to complete the game in less than two hours. For certain games, this length is not bad, but this is not a fast-twitch shooter and is very story-driven so the length is a problem. It feels like there isn\u0026#39;t enough content to warrant a full price. This might not be as much of a factor if you don\u0026#39;t pay full price, however.\nGraphics This is where I admit that I played this game on my Steam Deck. The Steam Deck to a fair job with the game and it looked very good, but the hardware did limit how detailed and sharp the graphics were. I believe this is more of a problem with the hardware and not with the game. The game has great potential and I\u0026#39;m sure the cat looks very nice and fluffy on better hardware. The art direction and style is great and the cities look crowded and lived in and yet abandoned all at the same time.\nStory The story is great! Again, if the game wasn\u0026#39;t so short it would be awesome and that is mostly because of the story. Maybe it would have been better as a movie, but I\u0026#39;m not sure how it could have been done. The medium does actually suit this style of storytelling. If only it was a bit longer. There is a story though, and it is deeeep. I won\u0026#39;t spoil anything, but, if you\u0026#39;re looking for a cute game where you\u0026#39;re just exploring a city as a cat, well you might be disappointed, but, if you keep your mind open you might enjoy the game for its awesome story telling and emotions. By the end of the story I really felt for my poor kitty. Don\u0026#39;t worry though, there is a good ending!\n","description":"Stray is a very cute game where you play as a cat!","id":22,"section":"reviews","tags":["review","game","cat","cute"],"title":"Stray [2.5/5]","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/reviews/stray/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep!\nHow is your summer? Is it hot enough for chu all yet? It is certainly hot enough for me, or at least it has been. Now, if your from like Arizona or Texas you might be thinking, why is this girl complaining about 94 degree weather, to which I say…That…is…still…hot 😝 Just you tend to get hotter and so it doesn\u0026#39;t seem as bad. Anyway, this is just a quick update for you all. I\u0026#39;ve made a few changes to parts of the site and have some plans I want to outline, mostly for myself. Let\u0026#39;s get started!\nWhat changed!? Honestly, not much, but the original version of this site was written a few years ago when I was…ahem…too invested in a certain MMORPG. While I still play it, its not nearly as much a part of my life as it was when I first wrote many of the pages of this site, including the introduction. So I changed them. Mostly just made minor adjustments, but the introduction page no longer shows my characters or there levels from Fiesta. If you want to find me in that game just start by locating Yayoi_chi or hit me up in the socials linked at the bottom of each page! Other than that I have made effort to highlight some of the other games I play and not solely call out Fiesta.\nSo about that new stuff… With the focus now more on all the games I\u0026#39;m playing, or have played, I am planning to flesh out the guides and may even and a place for reviews and/or stories from the games I am playing, but that isn\u0026#39;t the big news! I am also thinking, just thinking, about adding a section for short stories. You already get to see some of my drawings, but drawing is not my only creative outlet. Now, writing fiction usually takes me a long time and it is harder for me to release my writing than to show off my drawings, so you\u0026#39;ll have to be patient, and I might not even release this section, but I will keep you up to date. I plan on updating the site once a week now!\n","description":"Just a few notes on directions for the site and recent changes","id":23,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"A few site notes","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-07-20/"},{"content":" Over the past year I have been working as a behavior technician. This has been a fun and rewarding opportunity for me, but it has also be very taxing. I have worked long days and then I worked normal days but was also taking classes full time while working on a PhD. This left me with very little time for anything fun. Well, learning was fun, but not the right kind of fun. I was feeling burnt out and the stresses of managing my cases, dealing with things like tantrums, and all the hours worked were starting to get to me in an unhealthy way. Last month I made the decision to leave.\nToo many spinning plates It was certainly not easy to decide to leave my job. I did like the kiddos I was working with, well most of them, and the work was enjoyable, for the most part. I probably would have kept going too if it wasn\u0026#39;t for my grades last term. Reviewing all of my assignments I knew I wasn\u0026#39;t going to get the kinds of grades I wanted. I could spot everything I was doing wrong, but, whether it was lack of focus after an assignment or during the readings, I just couldn\u0026#39;t find a way to fix the mistakes I knew I was making. I had said that, if I went back to school, then that would take priority and nothing should harm that.\nIn fact, I came up with this little analogy. It was like I had two plates spinning on toothpicks. Both started out spinning just fine, but than they started to wobble and I couldn\u0026#39;t fix them without dropping at least one. I could try my hardest to get them both going again, but, at the end of the day, I needed to let one go so the other could spin right. I chose my work. It has fallen, but now I can have the time and energy to get the school plate spinning up right again!\nHobbies and mental health In truth there were probably more than the two plates. Perhaps one for this site, one for my other art and web projects, and maybe even one for video games. Hobbies, and other things that distract us from the grind of work, are required, I think, in maintaining our mental health. We can\u0026#39;t be all about work and school, or work and family, or even work, family, and school. We need to balance those things with \u0026#34;me\u0026#34; time. Time to just do what you really like to do with or without other people involved. This is where our hobbies come in. They provide unstructured time for us to just be us. I think I lost track of that over the last year, and that may be one reason things didn\u0026#39;t go so well at either work or school.\nMaybe not more time, but more quality time In the summary I said, we can\u0026#39;t make more time. This comes from an interaction between a parent and their child (my client). The child does not speak, but is learning sign language. They often make the sign for more followed by the sign for time. This is interpreted as a request for more time with something, a toy or activity. However, sometimes they would make these signs with no context and the parent would be left wondering what the child was requesting. This was a simple lexical error, but it led to the following interaction:\nchild signs more and time\nparent: More time? More time with what?\nchild repeats signs\nparent: More time? I can\u0026#39;t make more time! Time is a finite thing.\nIts true, time is a finite resource, we\u0026#39;re only given so much of it and we can\u0026#39;t just make more. What we can do though is make better use of the time we have. In other words, we can make more quality time or make our time better. This is what I intend to do now!\nLesson learned! So now I will be a bit picky with how I\u0026#39;m spending my time, I will be balancing it better not just between work (if I find another job) and school, but also between hobbies, family, and entertainment. All of these are important! Any future place of employment that would like me to work weekends or evenings will have to understand that is not something I will be doing, I won\u0026#39;t mind if it was something I occasionally had to do, but I will decide when and how often that is, it will not be decided for me. I am done with that part of my life now.\nAs for what the means for this site! Well, I\u0026#39;m hoping I\u0026#39;ll update it more often and add different guides and maybe new art more frequently. I hope you\u0026#39;ll look forward to that!\n","description":"You can't make more time, you can only make the most of the time you have!","id":24,"section":"news","tags":["news","personal","site"],"title":"More time!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-07-09/"},{"content":" I\u0026#39;m hoping this isn\u0026#39;t going to be a very long entry, but we won\u0026#39;t know that until I have written the whole thing 😝.

I let my parents know and I was visited with a COVID-19 test. I took the test and I tested positive for COVID in 2023!\nAbout my COVID Case I\u0026#39;ll get this out of the way really quick. If anyone reading this is worried, you don\u0026#39;t have to be. My case is very mild and I have been recovering rather quickly. I am keeping myself isolated and all is well so far. I will be unable to work for the next four days, but this is a procedure from the company due to the nature of my job.\nThe Good Part Believe it or not, this isn\u0026#39;t all bad. I\u0026#39;ve been feeling overworked and burnt out lately. I never have time for self-care and hobbies. This includes updating this website. I have time for this now and I have been playing games and drawing.\nIn fact, I\u0026#39;m hoping to add another picture to my Creations very soon. This one is taking a little long because I was not able to be up very long during the weekend, but I should have time to work on it a bit more soon, though I am working through some needed training and still doing school work as I don\u0026#39;t need to leave for that.\nFor the future Yesterday I started Portal again, I noticed something I haven\u0026#39;t noticed before. Portal is my favorite game and I\u0026#39;m still learning new things. I haven\u0026#39;t decided to, but I might add some Portal achievement guides or walkthroughs. Again, I\u0026#39;m not sure I will want to do this, but at least I warned you if I do decide to. I may also look into other walkthroughs and guides to add while I\u0026#39;m out. I know this isn\u0026#39;t much of a plan yet, but I just wanted to through this in here.\n","description":"COVID-19 is still here and I found out the hard way!","id":25,"section":"news","tags":["news","personal"],"title":"Covid Visit!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-05-15/"},{"content":" After pushing some updates to my Fiesta Guides a little early, I am back with a few small changes that I was not able to quite get done before having to push those updates!

I didn\u0026#39;t get much time to play, which is what I would\u0026#39;ve liked to do on my birthday, but I did have plenty of fun. At 39, birthdays mean something totally different than they did at 10 or 12. I may not have got any presents or had a ton of friends over, but I had a good time. That\u0026#39;s all that really matters. Speaking of friends, well, I don\u0026#39;t really have many. Let\u0026#39;s see if we can change that 😉\nNew addition to the bottom matter of the site! Since I originally deployed this version of the site I was aware I could put icons and links to my social media profiles on the bottom of the site near the footer in the template that I am using. Other than potentially putting my steam profile down there though, I didn\u0026#39;t really see much point in them, so I just put my e-mail in and that was that. Well I changed it!\nRecently, I joined Matrix and I had switched from Twitter to Mastodon a while ago, both of these sites are supported by the template so I figured, why not just put those in there, and why not have my Steam profile in too. So I added those! I am on Matrix most, but any of these options are good if you want to connect with me. We can talk about the site, MMO\u0026#39;s and JRPGS, or whatever. I would like to know people actually read these 😆\nFinally updated my introduction The introduction page was out of date in more than one way. Not only was my age out of date, but all the levels of my Fiesta characters also needed updating. I\u0026#39;ve since fixed that. There have also been small updates throughout the site including adding a link in the footer to my forums. Hey! That\u0026#39;s one other way you can reach me!\nLooking forward As I mentioned, I am busy pursuing a PhD and working. I\u0026#39;m hoping that the next year will not only see some progress on this front but also progress with gaming and the site. Also I\u0026#39;d like to draw more. So let\u0026#39;s hope it all comes together in the next year!\n","description":"I had a birthday!","id":26,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"Birthday!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-04-06/"},{"content":" First I did want to kind of get this out of the way! I\u0026#39;ve been playing a lot of games on my Steam Deck and I love it. Its a great thing to have when waiting in my car between appointments and shtuff! So far this has only really served to get in the way of finishing both my Made in Abyss and Persona 4 Golden guides because I have been basically hoping all over the place, including some older games 😉 Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll at least get back to Made in Abyss soon. As for what\u0026#39;s actually new, well… not much.\nYaya, where the heck are the updates? Well, the short of it is I\u0026#39;m busy and bad at time management 😅 I\u0026#39;ve been doing a little better and I\u0026#39;ve cut some hours at work, actually been having a lot of cancellations, which is actually why I\u0026#39;m writing this now. Aside from that I\u0026#39;ve been scheduling things and tracking time better. Hopefully I\u0026#39;ll be able to squeeze more time in to maintaining this site and maybe finish playing something so I can finish a guide other than my Fiesta guide.\nSo, I heard there\u0026#39;s a new gallery! There is! I\u0026#39;ve been doing these season-based wallpapers ever since I ran the Dracula theme on all of my devices last autumn. I decided I\u0026#39;d gather those and share them on my website. Now I\u0026#39;ve tried to attribute where I could, but I don\u0026#39;t remember where I got these wallpapers, and I did not make them. My e-mail is linked on all pages and you can also write a comment on the page and let me know if you\u0026#39;d rather me not link these images or if you know who to attribute them too. Please understand I did not steal these and do not claim they are mine. If you ask for them to be removed please provide proof of ownership and give me time to remove them. Otherwise enjoy the images!\nHow about so more art? Speaking of images, I am very aware that my Creations Gallery is looking pretty sparse. Amongst the various things I have not had time to do, drawing is just one of them. I\u0026#39;m hoping, with some of the extra time I have this week, that I will be able to add at least one more item to that gallery soon. Problem is… I have no idea what to draw. I literally have no ideas, but maybe inspiration will spark soon. I\u0026#39;d really like to have some new shtuff to show you!\nAny way, not really a good update, but I hope its good enough. I also hope I will have better updates soon!\n","description":"I added a wallpaper gallery!","id":27,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"New Gallery!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-04-03/"},{"content":"This is a collection of some of my favorite wallpapers.

You see I was working on playing Persona 4 Golden and completing guides for that game kept me updating the site fairly regularly. Unfortunately, my focused unexpectedly shifted to another game. I hadn\u0026#39;t originally wanted to do a guide on this game, but I found that it was taking a lot of my time and some of that is because I am ending up having to restart section and back track a lot. The game I\u0026#39;m referring too is Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness and it is definitely not easy. I like it, but it offers quite a challenge. After getting lost a few times and, as I mentioned, a lot of back tracking and reloading, I decided to start a guide and some maps for the game to make things a little easier. This has led to this new update for the site! I don\u0026#39;t really have anything else to report on, but thought I small update was better than none 😅\n","description":"Another new guide","id":29,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","mia"],"title":"Hard Game is HARD!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-03-12/"},{"content":" The first layer starts at the Netherworld Gate is fairly small and pretty easy to traverse!

My name is Yayoi and I am a moon whistle who has learned a thing or two about cave raiding. I\u0026#39;m writing down some of the things I\u0026#39;ve learned in hopes that it may help you out (and me 😜) out on your next cave raid! We\u0026#39;ll go over a few general tips here, nothing too specific, because, well, you know everything is limited. Speaking of limited, that this first thing I think you should remember about cave raiding.\nKnow your limits! As a cave raider who have to be mindful of your limits. How long can you run? How far can you climb? (stamina) How long can you survive without food or water (fullness)? How much pain can you endure (HP)? How much can you carry (g)? These are all very important things to keep in mind. As you get used to cave raiding you\u0026#39;re limits will increase, but you have to always be aware of this, because, if you forget you could easily find yourself in a very irredeemable situation.\nKnow your purpose! Because every resource is limited each cave raid should have a purpose, a reason you going down that day. That reason could be just to explore, it could be to complete a specific request, or it could be to get new experience, hunt relics, or gather resources. A specific purpose, however, helps you to limit how far you\u0026#39;ll go and what exactly you should bring with you.\nExploration If you are diving solely to explore The Abyss you have to be the most careful. You don\u0026#39;t want to starve before you can go very far nor do you want to be killed because you found a new creature you don\u0026#39;t have the means to fight. If you decide go down for exploration focus on bringing weapons, ammo, and food. You may want to focus on bringing ingredients for cooking rather than buying and carrying cooked dishes. However, you may need to bring a few big dishes with you depending on how far your initial dive will be.\nBringing ingredients with you as well as plenty of weapons and ammo means you can hunt while you explore. Cooked dishes are heavy, but ingredients for dishes are relatively light (except meat), meaning you can carry more ingredients, but don\u0026#39;t take every ingredient you can buy or carry. Focus on dishes you know you can get some of the ingredients for as you explore. For example, if you are in second layer, you know you can get plenty of eggs and bird meat as well as a lot of various herbs, so focus on bringing things like salt or spices that you can use with these ingredients to cook bird meat and eggs. There are only a few dishes that you can cook just by gathering ingredients in The Abyss, so keep this in mind when exploring.\nFinally, while exploring, only attack things you can cook and avoid attacking or being attacked as much as possible. You\u0026#39;ll bring a lot of weapons and ammo, but you\u0026#39;ll want to save these for things that you can kill to help you survive and not for defense if possible. Also don\u0026#39;t go to far at once. This goes back to knowing your limits. Know how far you can go with the supplies you have and only go about half that far so you have enough supplies to get back to the surface.\nRequests This is similar to exploration in that you will want to focus on weapons and ammo. Depending on how far you have to go to complete a request you may decide to bring less food or focus on pre-cooked dishes rather than ingredients. My one piece of advice for you though, is don\u0026#39;t take on too many requests at once! Focus on one request at a time unless you have requests that are both short and not far from each other.\nIf you come across a request while you are exploring this is where you have to make a potentially difficult decision. Take a look at your current supplies, decide how far you could go, then decide if you should return to the surface before completing the request or try to complete it with the resources you currently have. Some short requests can easily be done while your exploring, but don\u0026#39;t forget your initial purpose and don\u0026#39;t be mindful of what you can do with the supplies you currently have.\nRelic Hunting and Gathering If this is the reason you want to cave raid today, than you\u0026#39;ll want to keep as much room available for gathering or carrying relics as you can. Some advice, however, decide where you want to relic hunt or gather resources and take only the weapons and food that you\u0026#39;ll need to get to that location plus at least one extra weapon to defend yourself if you need to. If you are relic hunting, remember that cooked food is heavy and so are relics, so make sure you balance this well and focus on ingredients. Most things you\u0026#39;ll be gathering are fairly light so you can bring some cooked food with you if you want. If you want to do both at the same time then start by gathering, as these are lighter, and then move on to relic hunting as you use resources and weapons.\nKnow Where Your Going and Where You\u0026#39;ve Been Take this from a cave raider who has gotten lost more than her fair share of times, you\u0026#39;ll always want to know where you are, where you\u0026#39;re going, and where you\u0026#39;ve been. You\u0026#39;ll want to know these things for two reasons, to help you know how far you\u0026#39;ve gone and to know how to get back to the surface once you need to. No one wants to starve because they got lost!\nIts for this reason that I have begun putting together some maps to help you (and me) navigate The Abyss. So far I have mapped out all the various section of the first layer and how to traverse to and from each area. You can use these maps to help you navigate to specific areas and back in the first layer so you don\u0026#39;t get lost, like I have.\nAnother thing to remember is that it is far easier to descend in the abyss than it is to ascend. To put it another way going down is easier than going up. This is not just because climbing is harder than jumping down, but also due to the curse! If you go up too fast you\u0026#39;ll feel its effects and you\u0026#39;ll need to rest and get used to the new depth. I advise that you always take the time to do this when ascending because you don\u0026#39;t want to be blinded by the curse while creatures are near you or lose your lunch!\n","description":"Cave raiding is not an easy profession and there are certainly a few things you'll need to consider when making a dive.

Christmas has come and gone, along with all the winter-y shenanigans that game with it for Fiesta. I got a new lap desk for my computer setup, I went back to school after my winter break and…well some other life shtuff that we don\u0026#39;t need to talk about here ( \u0026gt; . \u0026gt; )\nNew Game! One good thing that happened this last month was the release of a remake of Persona 3 Portable on steam. I had started playing Persona 3 on PlayStation 2 a long time ago, I was really impressed with it, but never got to finish it. I\u0026#39;m looking forward to finishing it now. I will be writing guides for it has a play, just like I\u0026#39;m doing with Persona 4 Golden. Right now there is just an index up, since I\u0026#39;m still playing Persona 4, but I\u0026#39;ll get things going as soon as a start Persona 3.\nReturning to Eorzea One of my Christmas presents from a good friend, was the complete collection for Final Fantasy XIV. I really enjoyed playing this game when I first got the base game. It has a really good story, but I got stopped playing, even though I wasn\u0026#39;t finished with Havensward, when I hit max level because I didn\u0026#39;t want to get too far behind. Now that I have the expansions I\u0026#39;ve started playing again.\nFFXIV Guides? When? All that said I have a confession to make. Originally I wanted this site to focus on guides for MMOs because those could be a bit hard to find. So I started my fiesta guides. I was playing FFXIV for the first time as I wrote these and my plan was to write guides for that game next. Here\u0026#39;s the problem, I\u0026#39;m not sure what I can contribute here. There are plenty of guides already available online for FFXIV as it is a very popular game. For the time being, I won\u0026#39;t be writing guides for FFXIV. This could change in the future, if I can find a way to contribute. in the meantime, enjoy my other guides!\n","description":"I'm still building new guides and making the website bigger","id":32,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","persona","ffxiv"],"title":"Ready for a New Game!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2023-01-21/"},{"content":" First thing is first! Marry Christmas everyone! This week, Christmas came to Fiesta. Like the Halloween update, this is kind of a major thing that happens every year. I don\u0026#39;t look forward to it quite as much, but it is nice seeing everything in a more winter-like wonderland. There are some new events and stuff and I\u0026#39;ll see about adding them to my event guide, but, for now I have more news to share!\nBuggy Bug! First I need to make a quick announcement! Everyone, please update your bookmarks! The URL of this site may have changed slightly. Please use the https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/ URL for the main site. For some reason the old URL breaks the root navigation link in the navigation bar. This doesn\u0026#39;t appear to affect the Japanese version, but does effect the English version if your using an older URL that has \u0026#34;en/\u0026#34; in it.\nA guide not for Fiesta appears! Lately I\u0026#39;ve been playing some games that aren\u0026#39;t Fiesta. I know, shocking, isn\u0026#39;t it 😝. I mean I did say there were other games that I play and I did get something new to play games on (I\u0026#39;ll talk more about that in a bit), so why not play through some of my Steam backlog? While playing through that I started playing a certain JRPG that I just recently got on Steam after only having it for PS2 before.\nThe fun thing about JRPGs is they, like many RPGs actually, are very complicated and it can be challenging to get through everything without a guide. I like this challenge, but I like writing down things I discover along the way too. So I created a guide for Persona 4 Golden.\nI have split the guides up into sections, but, at the moment, many of these are just placeholders waiting for me to fill them up. You\u0026#39;ll have to bare with me a bit while I go about completing the story, writing my walkthrough, and working on the other sections. Normally I try to avoid the \u0026#34;under construction\u0026#34; signs and stuff that plagued sites in the 90\u0026#39;s, but this time I want you to see how the guides evolve so its not \u0026#34;under construction\u0026#34; its a \u0026#34;work in progress\u0026#34; 😆\nSteamy Deck is steamy I had a friend wanting to see my gaming setup, but, you know what, it really wasn\u0026#39;t much to look at. I don\u0026#39;t really like flashy RGB and I don\u0026#39;t have like a nice keyboard or even a monitor. Instead I had a very simple box connected to a TV. In fact, I was a console gamer pretending to be a part of the PC master race, really. You know what though, valve made a machine for people like me.\nYep its the Steam Deck! That\u0026#39;s it right there sitting on top of a PS4 slim 😆. It is still connected to a TV, not pictured, but it also rests on a shelf above the box that used to serve as my gaming PC looong ago. Still helps me run some old Windows games, like Fiesta 😉, but its mostly just a media and file server now.\nI like the Steam Deck so far, but I\u0026#39;ve only played it a little bit. It is very portable and a big lighter feeling than I was expecting when I first pulled it out. It is much larger than my Switch though. Oh, I have played it handheld a few times and it is really nice. The thing is like if a PC was thrown into a room with a Switch and they had a baby, especially with the dock. It is a Bring You Own Controller affair, but it is nice. Also, as you can tell, I\u0026#39;m not wanting for controllers at the moment. Actually, the two in the peekture are just two in a set of three PS4 controllers I have, and the JoyCon, Nintendo Switch Pro Wired Controller, XBox One Controller, Steam Controller, and SF30 Pro aren\u0026#39;t even shown. Yeah, I have a lot 😅\n","description":"I'm building new guides and making the website bigger","id":33,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","fiesta"],"title":"Make my website grow!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-12-17/"},{"content":" Welcome!\nThis is designed to help you figure out what to do on each day of Persona 4: Golden! This is designed to give you suggestions and hints, I will not be telling you exactly what to do each and every day, instead I favor giving you the options (read: things you can do) for each day, and giving you the choice of what you can do.\nI\u0026#39;m currently working through my playthrough, and, I\u0026#39;ve started this kind of in the middle of that playthrough. So I don\u0026#39;t have each day laid out just yet. For now I\u0026#39;ll be pulling from things I\u0026#39;ve read and my own memory, but hope to have a better, more organized, walkthrough up in the future. For now, I\u0026#39;ll be picking up at the second dungeon. The good news is, the first dungeon and the story to that point, is pretty straightforward. Nevertheless I will be covering that when I can.\nThe hot and steamy bathhouse! There is something just a little odd and unexpected about Kanji Tatsumi. On the third day after rescuing Yukiko, Kanji appears on the Midnight Channel. The first time the party sees this they aren\u0026#39;t entirely sure who it is, but it becomes clear after the second viewing. Sadly, they cannot confront Kanji before he is kidnaped. He appears once more in a steamy bathhouse, only he seems a little different.\n5/20 - 5/23 Kanji disappears around the 20th of May (5/20). The 20th is a Thursday. Even before he disappears, Dojima-san tells you to keep an eye out for Adachi in Junes. Believe it or not this is a clue, though its not really Adachi your looking for, but I digress.\nYou see, when Kanji disappears, you will head over to the TV world where your shocked to find that Teddy is having difficulty locating Kanji. To help him out, you need to learn more about the delinquent. To do so you need to find the young man you saw him speaking to just before he was kidnaped. Remember how I said Junes was a clue, well this young man can actually be found in Junes, but not every day. In fact, he is only there Tues., Thurs., and Sat. You need to find him, speak with him, then find Kanji\u0026#39;s mom and speak to her, but there\u0026#39;s a bit of a trick to this. She will only appear after you speak to the young man, and never on the same day you speak to him. So you have to time it right.\nAfter speaking to the young man, go about your day, maybe go to work or do whatever you want that day, keep in mind that your friends, and a few others won\u0026#39;t be available yet. On the next day, go to the textile shop. Kanji\u0026#39;s mom should be right outside, if she isn\u0026#39;t, go about your day as you normally would, if she is, speak to her first. Finally, on the next Tues., Thurs., or Sat. Find the young man and speak with him again. He\u0026#39;ll give you the clue you need to hand over to Teddy. You can hop into the TV right away to hand over the clue and gain access to the bathhouse, or wait until it is most convenient. You should have access to your friends and other social links once you have the clue, but I shared it with Teddy right away, so I\u0026#39;m not sure.\n5/24 - 6/3 If you do the above quickly you may have a bit more time. If your slower you may not have as much time. This is the date I started and should be a good amount of time to get this dungeon done and dusted. I\u0026#39;m still on this date.\nThe first two floors are fairly easy. Keep in mind that each floor is generated randomly by the game, just like with the previous dungeon. There will be chests to open and some fairly easy shadows to beat. There is a cutscene where the party gets their first glimpse of Kanji\u0026#39;s shadow, but this all that is of note. On my playthrough on easy I was easily able to reach this floor in one afternoon. As with all dungeons, mind your time and watch your party.\nAfter a few days I came back and got up to floor seven. On this floor you will encounter a sub boss. He isn\u0026#39;t too difficult. I does appear to have an instant kill skill, and my use it against your female party members. Best to have some revival beads on you. He does nullify light-based skills, and I was not able to find a weakness, though darkness wasn\u0026#39;t tested. I\u0026#39;ll put the output of his analysis below\nName Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Light Dark Daring Gigas 24 Strength 928 100 Nul ? 5/25 On this date you will get a cutscene before school introducing you to a new job, the Tutor job. This is a job that you can go to at night, tues., thurs., and sat. it pays very well (10,000 yen per day), but requires high understanding.\nMarie is also available to go out this day.\n5/26 There is a quiz in class today. This is a fairly easy question as long as you are paying attention. If you want to skip the dialog, however, the answer is, \u0026#34;attendance logs\u0026#34;.\n5/28 The mail order show starts. You can order things from the TV in your room. Watch for deals on Sun., Mon., and Tues.\n5/30 There is another lecture on this day, but there is no quiz and it does not affect what is available for you to do this day.\n6/1 Rain sets in today. This is the game\u0026#39;s warning that you will need to hurry and save Kanji. Marie is available this day as well. Also, it is good to remember that some part-time jobs and clubs cannot be done on rainy days.\n6/4 This is it! This is your last day to save Kanji. You have not made much progress in his dungeon by this point it will be a fairly difficult fight. My strategy, however, was to get to the last floor by 6/3 that allowed me to take on these boss\u0026#39;s with full HP/SP. The results of the analysis are below. Keep in mind that these guys appear to target female party members more, have opposing weaknesses, and can block each other\u0026#39;s weaknesses. This makes for a challenging fight even on lower difficulties. The fight is far from impossible especially for a fully rested party.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Kanji ? Emperor ? ? - - Dr - Null Null Tough Guy ?

In my playthrough rage seemed to effect the female party members while males were less effected. Poison appeared to work the opposite. I\u0026#39;ll update this when I have a chance to test it in other playthroughs\n6/5 Kanji returns! You will now have a few cutscenes to go through where the party will welcome Kanji to their group and discuss the case thus far. Congratulations on finishing the bathhouse!\n6/6 A lot is about to happen and yet hardly anything happens. Here\u0026#39;s what I mean. Over the next several days nothing happens on the midnight channel and nothing new happens in the TV world, however, a lot of events and story notes will take place. At the moment the party will just discuss changes to the killer\u0026#39;s MO and other notes about the case to this date.\n6/8 There is a lecture today. There will be a question, the answer to which is \u0026#34;balance beam\u0026#34;. After the lecture you will begin discussing getting a motorcycle license.\n6/9 You\u0026#39;ll get your license today and you are gifted a scooter. You can practice riding it and unlock other areas to travel from doing so.\n6/13 This is the first day of summer, yay?\n6/15 There is a quiz this day too, the answer is \u0026#34;cheerfulness in a group\u0026#34;.

The party suspects she might be the next victim. There is a quiz this day to, the answer is \u0026#34;Meiji\u0026#34;. There is a special boss in the bathhouse.

As a result, she is struggling with her true self and the \u0026#34;manufactured personality\u0026#34; she has as an idol.\n6/21 - 6/23 After the party begin to suspect that Rise may be the next target, she begins to appear on the Midnight Channel. Unlike before, they will immediately identify her. Like before, they will not be able to save her, so it will be off to the TV for you.\n6/24 Like with Kanji, Teddy has difficulty pinpointing Rise in the TV world even after her program begins on the Midnight Channel. He asks you to go get more information about her. You need to ask around town to find out more about Rise. You can start with either the tofu shop she works at where the old lady tells you about the paparazzo hanging around or you can start at the school where you can speak to a chubby man at Practice Building 2F who tells you a bit more about Rise and also advises you to speak with someone in the media. Either way you will eventually have to speak to both of them. Once you do, you will be advise to look for paparazzi at the flood plain. You won\u0026#39;t find any yet, but the \u0026#34;kind man\u0026#34; there will advise you to look tomorrow.\n6/25 Now you can head back to the flood plain and find the \u0026#34;photographer\u0026#34; (if you don\u0026#39;t want to/can\u0026#39;t do this today, note that the \u0026#34;photographer\u0026#34; is only there Tues., Thurs., and Sat.). Give the man two pieces of info about Rise, basically all options except that she is in town. With this, he gives you enough information that Teddy should be able to pinpoint Rise. Take this information back to the TV to unlock the dungeon.\n6/26 - 7/9 You have a couple of weeks to save Rise from her shadow. Marukyu Striptease, like the previous two dungeons is roughly 10 floors with a final fight on the next floor after that. There are many different types of shadows and they will begin introducing shadows that nullify or even repel certain elemental attacks. Stay on your toes. Keep a full and diverse party. You can decide what role the main character plays, but I kept him as my Lightning, Dark, and Light damage dealer. Also relay on the analysis option to keep everything sraight. You don\u0026#39;t want to accidently use a repelling element. At about 7F you will be met with a sub-boss. This fight shouldn\u0026#39;t be too difficult, but a fresh party would be helpful as it will likely start with stagnant air (to increase suseptibility for ailments) and will attempt to poison your party. Here are its full stats as reported by analysis after scanning for weaknesses and strengths.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Amorous Snake 33 Lovers 1012 148 - - - - Null Null After this fight the floor mazes will start to get a bit more complicated, and you\u0026#39;ll be dealing with some more difficult shadows. Be very careful as one of them will repel dark, if you aren\u0026#39;t careful you could end up instant KOing yourself (leading to an instant game over). After completing ten floors, I suggest leaving and coming back another day so you are well rested for a two part fight.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Rise ? Lovers ? ? - - - - Null Null Shadow Rise has no weaknesses, but is more than capable of taking advantage of your weaknesses. She is able to use any basic elemental attack. I did not see evidence of light or dark attacks. At a certain point in the fight she will begin to analyze you (yeah I didn\u0026#39;t see this coming at all). When this happens you will be unable to hit her. Just keep guarding for a few more turns to trigger dialog and a suprise twist.\nNames Lvl Archon Full HP Full SP Fire Ice Lightning Wind Light Dark Shadow Teddie ? Moon ? ? - Dr - - Null Null It is after the twist that the real fight begins. Shadow Rise, was pretty easy actually, now its time for Shadow Teddie! This will be a real fight. Like Shadow Rise, Teddie has no weaknesses. He will also attempt to lower your party\u0026#39;s defenses right away and inflict other ailments. Eventually he will begin charging attacks. At these points, make sure all party members are guarding when the message \u0026#34;Shadow Teddie is charging up\u0026#34; is displayed. You will block the attack fully. Careful though! Shadow Teddie will attempt to inflict dizzy on a party member, or two, before charging up.\n7/4 There is a lecture and a pop quiz today. The answer to the question is \u0026#34;Pascal\u0026#34;\n7/7 Another lecture and quiz this day. The answer to the question is \u0026#34;The Decleration of Independence\u0026#34;\n7/10 So Teddie joins the party in a new capacity and new form (yeah that was also surprising) and our super cute idol Rise will join the party. She replaces Teddie as your analysist, however, so don\u0026#39;t expect her to be fighting alongside you. Your homeroom teacher was murdered last night and his story appears today on the news.\n7/11 You get a new homeroom teacher. Brace yourself for that, by the way, she isn\u0026#39;t exactly any better than your last. Also, brace yourself for a barrage of cutscenes as everyone discusses the case so far.\n7/12 Nothing much happens now. Take a nice rest! Finals start next week!\n7/13 - 7/16 To help you prepare for next week\u0026#39;s finals, you will have a series of pop quizzes. The answers are relatively easy though if you pay attention in class, you do pay attention, don\u0026#39;t you? Well, since this isn\u0026#39;t a real school, I guess I can let you look at my answers:\n7/13: sphenopalatine gangloinueralgia 7/14: Kuukai 7/15: the equator 7/16: no mustache Enjoy your weekend! Note: Marie is available 7/13 as well\n7/19 - 7/23 Finals week is here. Again, just because this is a game and not a real class, I\u0026#39;ll let you look at my notes, but you really should just be paying attention in class.\nDay 1, Quiz 1: cheerfulness in a group Day 1, Quiz 2: balance beam Day 2, Quiz 1: 応 Day 2, Quiz 2: Meiji Day 3, Quiz 1: king of hearts Day 3, Quiz 2: pascal Day 4, Quiz 1: pis pis river Day 4, Quiz 3: deceleration of independence 7/23 You will meet to discuss the case a bit more. Pick \u0026#34;formaldehyde\u0026#34; when asked. The Lovers arcana is opened to you!\n7/25 You will get your test results today. How did you do? I gave you all the answers, so you should have done well 😝\n7/26 - 7/27 Time for a new midnight TV, nothing else happens. Just sit back and enjoy the story. In fact you can sit back for two days! You will meet the next day to try and figure out who the boy is. Actually you probably should sit around the second day. You should go talk to Kanji real quick on the second day you\u0026#39;ll need to do this if you want to open the next dungeon quickly.\nVoid Quest Have you found the culprit at last? Only one way to find out! Back into the TV with you! Keep in mind that summer vacation offically started 7/28, sorry I forgot to tell you. This means you will not have to worry about school or club activities. It also means those social links are blocked from progression at this time.\n7/28 - 7/29 If you couldn\u0026#39;t or didn\u0026#39;t talk to Kanji, you should be able to do so now, also take his suggestion and talk to Doujima, though it doesn\u0026#39;t seem helpful, you can actually use this to get some info out of Adachi, but not on the first day as he is probably not available. Better wait until the second, you\u0026#39;ll learn from Adachi that the boy was a part-timer at one of the shops. In fact, it was Souzai Daigaku in the north section of the shopping district (the steak place). Once you talk to the owner there, you should see a boy with blonde hair and a school bag hanging around the tofu shop. You\u0026#39;ll get a yearbook photo of the culprit from him. This will be all Risa needs to track him down. If, for some reason, he does not appear, the boy will appear again on 8/1, make sure you have completed all the steps above, before that time. I don\u0026#39;t know when he\u0026#39;ll show up again, but he does not show up on every day.\n7/29 - 8/12 This dungeon is modeled after an old point-and-click-adventure game, or maybe an 8-bit RPG brought into a 3-D world, one of those two. If you have been leveling diligently, the shadows here will probably be pretty easy. Just, as always, watch your HP and SP and pace yourself. You have about two weeks to complete this dungeon. Chapter 3 and Chapter 7 will probably confuse you. Chapter three looks like a dead end, but you will be teleported around if you get close to some of the walls. Just be mindful of where you\u0026#39;ve been and how you got there to avoid backtracking and you should make it to the stairs. Chapter 7 will try to confuse you by moving your move direction and camera around on you. Just gotta power through that one, eventually you\u0026#39;ll get to the stairs.\n8/3 Marie will be available for you to have a good time with 😜\n","description":"A walkthrough for Persona 4: Golden","id":34,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","walkthrough","p4g","persona","wip"],"title":"Walkthrough","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/p4g/walkthrough/"},{"content":"I draw too!

Currently I\u0026#39;m hoping to keep this to one page and just have a few helpful tricks and hints to completing the events. This will be far from a complete guide to everything about the event, but should be enough for you to have looots of good fun!\nMaze of Madness First up is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness! The Maze of Madness comes about around Halloween time each year. Halloween is celebrated in the US on the 31 of October every year and is all about spooky things! It also happens to be one of my favorite holidays because there is nothing quite as fun as spooky shenanigans. Fortunately the maze is pretty spooky, though kind of more in a juvenile since, but I degrees.\nDuring this event, your goal is to pick up little Halloween tickets. These tickets can be used to purchase all sorts of goodies including permanent outfits! Of course, the maze itself is only one way to earn these tickets, but you can get up to three each time you complete the maze. One ticket for completing it and then two for helping to beat the boss that you can get to by talking to an NPC at the maze\u0026#39;s center.\nPictured are the various routes you can take to reach the center of the maze. To get to the Maze you must travel through a portal by the fountain in Elderine (Sir Gourd van Pumpkin also stands near this portal, you can exchange your tickets with him for items!). This will take you to the Maze of Madness world where you will then have to head for another portal directly in front of where you spawn to enter the maze proper. You will spawn in one of three locations, these are numbered on the map. Also pictured are the spawn locations as they appear in the in-game map.\nOther Quests Before heading into the maze, however, it\u0026#39;s a good idea to look around at the small town-like area you spawn into. There are two NPCs here. These NPCs have quests and each quest can help you get even more tickets. Some of these quests are repeatable and some are daily. Unlike most quests the Fiesta Wiki does not list these quests, but they are usually pretty straightforward. Most of them just require you to gather items from either tombstones or pumpkins from patches outside the maze and return them to the NPCs. There is one, however, that I would like to single out.\nPop goes the Pumpkin This is a daily quest that you can acquire from JackO Pumpkin Jr., the NPC nearest the maze sign. This requires you to beat the maze and the boss you can fight after speaking to the NPC at its center, Pumpkin Bill. I single it out both because it is different and because it awards 10 tickets per day! To beat the boss, gather from pumpkins in the area around Bill. These pumpkins allow drop grenades and warheads. Equip these to your skill bar for ease. You cannot damage Bill with your regular attacks and your skills are locked in this world, so you must throw these items at the boss until he falls. It takes about 100 grenades to take him down, if you\u0026#39;re lucky, however, you won\u0026#39;t be alone. Return to the NPC after you kill him to get a body back in your inventory, open this for some goodies and your 10 tickets!\nOther Things to Note There are titles for completing the maze under a certain time or certain conditions. One condition I remember was running it in under two minutes as a pinky (the candies you acquire from body bags and other rewards will randomly transform you into mobs) and completing the maze in under two minutes normally. I\u0026#39;ll update this section as more things come to mind!\nTerry! (Easter egg event) This is a list of where Terry can appear.

I did say that before you read the last article that I would be proven wrong and that Gamigo would droup the halloween update. I even said I would be happy if they did. Well, so, they did just that! You heard me right we have all the halloween vibes we could ever want in most of the towns of Isya!\nMaze of Madness Like last year, there is far more going on than just a makeover for most of the cities and towns in Fiesta. There are also events! Now, you can read the full list on gamigo\u0026#39;s news page, but my favorite is the frustratingly fun Maze of Madness. This is where you have to navigate your way through a maze while avoiding a certain monster, if they hit you, your out and you have to start the maze all over again. As I said, it can be very frustrating, but it can also be very fun! Last year I loved to run through the maze with friends. Unfortunately they\u0026#39;ve mostly moved on to other games, but a few still run around with me, and that\u0026#39;s great.\nA new guide? The maze can be a bit tricky to navigate, but a friend made a good graphic to help so I\u0026#39;ve put together a guide that shows how to get through the maze as well as a few other tips and tricks. Of course I don\u0026#39;t remember everything from last year, and I believe my characters all got the titles already, but I\u0026#39;ll do my best. When I get the guide made I\u0026#39;ll link it here for you.\nGlad I\u0026#39;m wrong! In this guess I\u0026#39;m really happy I was wrong. I was very worried that I wouldn\u0026#39;t get Halloween content this year, but I did and that\u0026#39;s awesome! There is still one problem….the problem of time. Since I began working I have, naturally, less time for playing games. I managed to squeeze in a little this week, but I\u0026#39;m not sure it will be enough for all the rewards. I suppose I can only hope that I\u0026#39;ll have just as much fun this year as I did last!\n","description":"So, I was wrong 😅","id":37,"section":"news","tags":["fiesta","news"],"title":"The halloween towns are here!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-10-27/"},{"content":" Hi hi everypeep 👋🏻\nIs everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and….the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October. However, it is now almost Halloween proper, just 11 days of the day I\u0026#39;m writing this, and still no sign of my spook-tacular towns 🥲\nNo news is good news? So, naturally, someone might think, well golly Yayoi you just gotta be patient, after all they haven\u0026#39;t said their not doing Halloween shinanigins, right? I mean sure, that\u0026#39;s true, but it isn\u0026#39;t like they haven\u0026#39;t mentioned Halloween at all. Earlier this week the Fiesta Online team posted this article on their site\u0026#39;s official news section. The mention Jack-O Pumpkin, who has been a staple of events surrounding the Halloween update, but what is the actual news? The scarier-than-every Halloween sale yay! They talk about getting Halloween-themed costumes, masks, tails, and other stuff for 30% off in the item store, but no mention of anything else related to Jack-O\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;favorite time of year\u0026#34; I know, they still haven\u0026#39;t mentioned that they aren\u0026#39;t doing anything, but this seems like they would rather just throw up a sale, maybe make some extra money and have the whole holiday done and dusted!\nWhat has happened to Halloween? This is really my favorite time of year, always has been. I love any excuse to celebrate things scary, creepy, and even a bit gory (just don\u0026#39;t tell my friends 😉), yet it seems everyone is just skipping over Halloween. I mean, I guess I get it, from a marking standpoint, Halloween, Thanksgiving (US), and Christmas are all right in line and the last two are very major holidays, and, with both Halloween and Christmas being about giving something out and getting something back, it makes since for companies like Gamigo to pour more energy into Christmas than Halloween. Doesn\u0026#39;t mean I have to like it though 😤\nI could be wrong Maybe, by the time this goes up and/or the time you read it, I\u0026#39;ve been proven wrong and Gamigo did, in fact, release the Halloween content I know and love. I would love for that to be the guess.

I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I\u0026#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the \u0026#34;real\u0026#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought that was awesome, but I haven\u0026#39; really spent much time practicing Japanese over the years, despite having actually written an entire essay in the language for my second year final project. Fast-forward to today! I\u0026#39;ve begun practicing again by essentially relearning it 😅 I haven\u0026#39;t really gotten super far into my studies, but, I am remembering I a lot from before and I have decided to translate the pages of this site into Japanese to help me further hone my skills. But I think I can use some help.\nGoogle Translate…NO! So umm, the Introduction has been written in Japanese. Other section home pages are not translated and really just say that, but the introduction page is translated. Here\u0026#39;s the problem. I failed to find some words in my old Japanese vocabulary and don\u0026#39;t have my old English to Japanese dictionary. Google Translate to the rescue, right!? Well kind of. Where has Google Translate can be a good English to Japanese, Japanese to English, or Any Language to Any Other Language dictionary, it isn\u0026#39;t so good at translating full sentences accurately, this is really more art the science. Sure, I\u0026#39;m 98% sure whatever its outputting can be understood by Japanese speakers, I\u0026#39;m not sure it maintains my tone and stuff. I\u0026#39;m also not sure if what it outputs is something Japanese speakers would really expect to hear, kinda hard to explain, but machine translation can sound too technical and or robotic and nothing like human speech even if it is technically correct.\nOf course, I know all this so I don\u0026#39;t use Google Translate like that, right? Well not exactly. Its easy to just throw a sentence in there see that the output makes since at least and then call it good enough. I try to avoid that, mostly by breaking down what I\u0026#39;m trying to say into something close to what I know how to say, but it happens. So I\u0026#39;m calling on anyone who knows both Japanese and English to help me!\nYou can help! At the bottom of each page is a comment box. I would really like these to be for general comments, but, in the case of the Japanese versions of each page I\u0026#39;d also like these to be used to help me with my Japanese and, more specifically, the translation of that page. You see, those comment boxes generate a GitHub issue I can look at, tag, and then implement, so, if you happen to have a GitHub account (or don\u0026#39;t mind making one 😉) and know both Japanese and English near fluently than fill free to suggest corrections to the Japanese pages using the comment boxes. Please to provide detailed explanations as to why your version make more since so I can learn. You can, of course, start with the introduction page. Just go there, click the language icon at the bottom-left, switch to Japanese (日本語), and comment, that easy!\nThanks!\n-Yayoi\n","description":"Since I'm learning Japanese, I've decided to put it into practice, by translating this site!","id":40,"section":"news","tags":["site","news","help"],"title":"Japanese Translation","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-10-15/"},{"content":" Hello everypeep!\nIf any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven\u0026#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform. First, I guess I little background information is in order.\nYaya\u0026#39;s World and how it was built before If you have visited the site and had a look at your address bar you may have noticed that page was a static HTML page. Every page had the same navigation bar, the same top bar, and the same header. Some might think this was done using Dreamweaver, and it was, at first. Recently though every page was actually written in a simple markup language, then it was built into HTML with all the standard stuff added in by a my editor of choice and that the result was then uploaded to a server. This allowed me to write and edit everything in a pretty distraction free way but still have navigation and everything working on each page on the site. Unfortunately, it became a bit of a chore to build the site and maintain all those template parts (the header and footer). So I just kinda stopped doing it ( ^ ~ ^ ;;\nHow I am trying to build the site now I recently came across an interesting YouTube video by someone named Chris Titus. He was showing off how he managed to keep is site up-to-date and do all the other things he does on a daily basis. I found this kinda of interesting and an answer to my problem of keeping my own site up-to-date. Now I am using Hugo with a theme he recommends to work on my site.\nWhat is Hugo? I don\u0026#39;t know if Hugo makes building websites fun again per se, but it certain makes things easier. Simply put Hugo is a framework for building websites. Its a program that I have installed on my MacBook that takes my ramblings written in Markdown or a similar markup language and builds HTML webpages with from them using a theme that provides some of the things my old site has. This can then be deployed to a my webserver, but this is almost exactly how things worked before only there is less gobbly goop that I have to maintain myself. However, Hugo does a bit more than just build the website.\nHow does Hugo help me? Aside from managing a theme and template for me where I use simple configurations to add and remove things that then apply to all pages and building a static site, Hugo provides a little webserver that allows me to see changes in realtime as I edit them. So I just type in my editor using a simple markup language than save those changes and then go to a browser that is already open to my local webserver and those changes are already applied, no need to hit refresh. This happens whether I\u0026#39;m changing a webpage, editing a theme configuration, or adding something new. I can literally see how it will look on the site before I deploy to the site all without having to hit refresh or anything but just looking at a browser window. Its really helpful. Also I was able to set up a little script I can run that will build and deploy the site with one command, so that\u0026#39;s also cool.\nA regression Everything isn\u0026#39;t quite peachy though. Many of the image-heavy pages, like the ADVENTURES gallery are not up anymore. This is a limitation of how I have Hugo set up currently. I\u0026#39;ll be looking into fixing this has I move forward, however, so hopefully all those memories will be back soon.\nPlans for the future So now I\u0026#39;m hoping to use this platform to expand the site beyond Fiesta Online. I\u0026#39;ve played many other games and, though I still spend most of my time playing MMOs in Fiesta Online, I would like to expand this site to include some of the other things that I end up playing, even things that might not be MMOs ( ^ . ~ ). I hope anyone who might be reading this will stick around and see how this site evolves in the coming months!\n-Yayoi\n","description":"This site is being moved to a new platform in hopes that I won't forget about updating it anymore ( ^ ~ ^ ;;","id":41,"section":"news","tags":["site","news"],"title":"A New Platform a New Look!","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/news/2022-10-12/"},{"content":" While on an ADVENTURE with Yayoi, Baby ended up chasing a sheep.

Of course Touka wouldn\u0026#39;t just do anything just to be nice. \u0026#34;How about 1000 gems!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s not fair!\u0026#34; Baby shouted. \u0026#34;Who even has that much!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay fine, but I\u0026#39;m not going to make this easy!\u0026#34; Touka responded, \u0026#34;How about I just tell you where some else who saw her went?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You should just tell us where Yayoi is?\u0026#34; Baby huffed.\n\u0026#34;Where\u0026#39;s the fun in that,\u0026#34; Touka teased. \u0026#34;Why not go find a pink haired cleric in a forest and see if she knows where your mama is!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Which other forest? There\u0026#39;s a ton of them!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know, but I know it is not far!\u0026#34;\nThe group of friends decided to take Baby to the Forest of Mist since it was very close to the Sea of Greed and, mostly by chance, they happened across a certain cleric that definitely fit Touka\u0026#39;s description.\n\u0026#34;Tama-mama!\u0026#34; Baby cried.\n\u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s wrong Baby?\u0026#34; Tama asked\n\u0026#34;Touka is being mean again…but that\u0026#39;s not the real problem.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;We\u0026#39;re looking for Yayoi,\u0026#34; Narumi, one of the friends, interjects.\n\u0026#34;Oh my goodness, you lost Yayoi!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Uh huh,\u0026#34; whimpered Baby.\n\u0026#34;Well, I did see her,\u0026#34; Tama explains, \u0026#34;but that was awhile ago. She looked like she was frantically searching for something. Maybe it was you.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Where was she looking?\u0026#34; inquired Narumi.\n\u0026#34;Well, I saw her in Vine Tomb, but I\u0026#39;m sure she was headed for a gate. Not sure which one, but I\u0026#39;m certain she\u0026#39;s not in Vine Tomb anymore.\u0026#34;\nThe group begins to deliberate. There are two gates in that area, but they decide to head to Dark Passage. They couldn\u0026#39;t find her there, but, since someone mentioned Moonlight Tomb, Narumi decided to head there ahead of everyone. She hears Yayoi shouting for Baby and informs the rest of her friends, who all head over to her.\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m so happy you found Baby again!\u0026#34; Yayoi exclaims.\n\u0026#34;Yayoi!\u0026#34; Baby cries.\nYayoi explains that she got separated from Baby and, instantly, and frantically started looking for her, eventually ending up in Moonlight Tomb where Narumi, and her friends, found her. She\u0026#39;s so happy to see BabyYayo again and vows to keep a better eye on her in the future. We shall see!\n","description":"Yayoi has lost BabyYayo!

Well cap is 140 now so I guess it\u0026#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. So, here\u0026#39;s some ideas of what you can do. The same caveat exists with this guide as with the last one. My current highest level character is 140, but she is a cleric, so I have not tried some of these suggestions alone. If you have better suggestions, though, let me know, you can comment on this page with a GitHub account, or send me an e-mail!\nDailies, Dailies, Dailies, and more Dailies Your best bet for a while at least is to continue to do the dailies you\u0026#39;ve been doing up until this point. As I said above, there are no KQs for passed 135 that offer any significant amount of exp, however, many of the hidden dailies and other daily quests you got when you got to 132 are still viable passed 135 and offer some exp. A member of one a guild I am in has broken down the amount of exp, in percentage, that you receive for various levels passed 135. Please note: this is the percentage if you complete all available dailies quests, not the percentage per quest!\n135 - 16.70% 136 - 13.22% 137 - 11.02% 138 - 9.07% 139 - 4.60% New Reps! There are new reps for you to complete as well. Well a couple anyway.\nYuna 3 (135-136) Soul Rep (136-138) Bug Rep (138-139) Questing The fiesta wiki offers a few options for quests for this level range. It has been recommended to relay on dailies and reps until at least 139. This will allow you to save your quests for when normal quests are suuuper in-effective, and hopefully make that last level just a little faster.\n","description":"The current cap is 140, these are adventurers that are a stone's throw from that (135-140) so yeah, pretty god-like!","id":43,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"God-like Adventurers","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/lvling/gods/"},{"content":" Before we begin, it is important to understand that everything in Fiesta is divided into tiers, this includes weapons, armor, and jewlery. Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones. For your reference:\nTier 1 refers to level 1~20 items Tier 2 refers to level 20~50 Tier 3 to 51~80 Tier 4 to 81-99 Tier 5 to 100+ Tier 6 is rserved for lgendary weapons. Enhacement Breakage When enhancing and item, there is a possibility it will break. However, some items seem to have a kind of safe zone in which they won\u0026#39;t break until a certain point. There is still a chance of downgrading, but that doesn\u0026#39;t cause you to lose the item like breaking. Here are the safe zones:\nGenerally best to follow the rule of safe until +3, but here are the more specific safe zones:\nTier 1 never break up to +5 Tier 2 and Tier 3 don\u0026#39;t break until +4 Tier 4 and Tier 5 don\u0026#39;t break until +3 Maximum Enhancement Just how high can you enhance items? Depends on the type\nAccessories: Tier 1-5 can be enhanced to +9 Armor: Tier 1-5 can be enhanced to +10 Shields: Tier 1-5 can also go to +10 Weapons: Tiers 1\u0026amp;2 can only go to +10 while 3-5 can go upto +12 Note: You will need a special stone called \u0026#34;Karis\u0026#34; to go past +9\nStones These are the types of stones you need. The tier of the stone needs to be equal to the tier of the item, as mentioned above.\nTier 1-5 enhacement stones for weapons, gears, and accessories\nElrue: +1, +2, and +3 Lix: +4, +5, and +6 Xir: +7, +8 and +9 Karis: +10, +11, and +12 These stones come in tree colors:\nGreen are normal, they have no special effects and will increase by +1 Purple are Blessed, they have a higher chance of upgrading by +1 and even a very small chance of upgrading +2 Blue are lucky their chance of upgrade is lower than blessed, but it has a higher chance to upgrade by +2 As a general rule NEVER use a lucky elrue when your enhancing a +2 weapon or gear at tier 4 or 5! According to users of the forums: \u0026#34;The chance of breakage is low, but it CAN HAPPEN, and it happened with a lot of us.\u0026#34;\nAs Tier 6 weapons are special they use a special enhacement stone called \u0026#34;Crystal of bijou\u0026#34; for all of their stages (+1 ~ +12)\nBracelets also use a special \u0026#39;stone\u0026#39; for enhancing. I haven\u0026#39;t had much experience with bracelets, but I\u0026#39;ll list what I know:\nTier 1-4 bracelets use fragements of bijou\nTier 1: +1 - +5 Tier 2: +1 - +10 Tier 3: +1 - +15 Tier 4: +1 - +20 This fragments are also colored:\nLight blue are brilliant and will NOT break and item, but they have chance to downgrade and fail Pink are radiant and will not break or downgrade, but can still fail Rainbow are splendid and do not break or downgrade and has a 30% success rate Note radiant and splendid are cash store items.\nSC Enhacement Stones These are often purchased in bundles (as this is much more affordable) so people use call these bundles. You\u0026#39;ll probably want all three types at once anyway, so might as well bundle \u0026#39;em 😉\nPerfect red eye: Decreases breakage rate by 100% Perfect blue mile: Decreases chance of downgrade by 100% Gold nine: Increases chance of enhacement success by 15-25% You should really save the red eyes for when items actually have a chance of breaking, see \u0026#34;Enhancement Breakage\u0026#34; above.\nExtra Tips (Free of Charge 😉) Try to avoid places that are highly populated or use shift+z to hide players Try to use blessed elrue for items above +2 Use normal for 0 to +2 ","description":"We go over guides and strategies to enhance gear while avoiding breakage!","id":44,"section":"guides","tags":["guide","gear","weapons"],"title":"Enhancement Guide","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/enhancement/"},{"content":" The Lucky House can be entered by speaking to the Lucky House Guide in the following towns:\nElderine Uruga Alberstroll Ruins Note: Your character must be at least level 40 to enter the Lucky House.\nThe Lucky House is a place where you can exchange in-game gems, gold, etc for coins that can be used for a variety of gambling games.

Each class is best suited to a particular role such as Damange Dealer (DD), Damage over Time (DoT), Area of Effect (AoE), Tank, or Support. I won\u0026#39;t go into details as to which class works best in which role as that is laid out very well on Fiesta\u0026#39;s Main Site. However builds can be tricky since each class has its own strength and weaknesses while its leveling such that what works for Archers my not work for Mages (even though they both specialize in AoE). So, here are the generally accepted builds and what classes to use with them 😉.\nAll STR This is easy as from the start, you just dump all of your skill points into STR. At first this seems like a really good build for all characters, but a character without DEF dies 😵. One might be tempted to use this for a tank role, but tanks are supposed to take dmg not give it. Really the only classes where this build works is Crusader, as they have good DEF by default and also have support skills, and Fighter (Gladiator Specifically) that focus more on DD roles than tanking.\nClasses: 🗡🛡👻🏹\nFull END Like All STR, full END just has you dump all of your points in one stat, in this case END. This will maximize your health and defenses. This is well suited for support classes, especially clerics, and tanks. People tend do die if the clericor tank dies so the more defense and HP they have the better.\nClasses: 🛡🗡✝️\nTotally DEX Dumping all your points into DEX may seem odd, but some classes can really utilize this well. Besides who needs DEF if the mobs can\u0026#39;t even hit you 🤪. Keep in mind though, you are sacrificing your potential in other areas. This really only makes since when you can kill fairly quickly too, so only DDs really, and you will still need some DEF. Just be careful with this one.\nClasses: 👻🏹\nPure SPR I\u0026#39;m listing this just because its a possibility to maximize your character\u0026#39;s SP, M.DEF, and crit rate, but you will need very good gear or you still won\u0026#39;t do much dmg and will probably die a lot too 😅.\nClasses: 🧙🏹\n33 DEX/Rest STR The above DD build (All STR) is great, but it ignores aim. Sprinkling in a few points to SPR, until you have 33 (or maximum of 67) fixes this helping your DD hit more often. This build is well suited for all those recommended for the All STR builds.\nClasses: 🗡🛡👻\n25 SPR/Rest END The above support build (Full END) is also great, but it ignores SP and crit rate. You can sprinkle in a few points into SPR until you have 25 to fix this, I highly recommend this build for Holy Knights since they tend to burn through available SP, also anyone in a support role can use some extra crits when they need to solo 😉.\nClasses: 🛡🗡✝️\n25 SPR/33 DEX/Rest STR This build maximize your attack power and crit rate while making it you a hard target to hit. You can use gear to help with DEF and M.DEF.\nClasses: 🏹🧙👻\n50 END/33 DEX/25 SPR/Rest STR If you\u0026#39;re looking for a wellrounded build that is nearly perfect for player-versus-player (PVP), this is the build for you. A reminder though, this is a jack-of-all-trades/master-of-none type situation, and many classesw have gear and armor to help with stats like END.\nClasses: 🛡🏹🧙👻\n","description":"A basic overview of the types of builds in Fiesta Online","id":47,"section":"guides","tags":["guide"],"title":"Builds","uri":"https://onigirionegai.info/~yayoi/guides/fiesta/builds/"}]
