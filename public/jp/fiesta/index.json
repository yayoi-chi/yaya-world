After, finally, catching up to the sheep, Baby gave it a nice pet. It was so fluffy and soft, she couldn\u0026#39;t resist. She looked around and found that she was no longer with Yayoi. In fact, Yayoi was no where to be seen. Fortunately a party of friends was out on an ADVENTURE of their own and found her, now in Burning Hill, by herself. The friends ask baby to retrace her steps. Baby leads them back to Sea of Greed, where she last saw Yayoi, but Yayoi had already moved on. However, the group did encounter someone in Sea of Greed.\n\u0026#34;You lost your mama again, didn\u0026#39;t you?\u0026#34; Touka laughs.\n\u0026#34;None of your business, Touka!\u0026#34; Baby hisses.\n\u0026#34;What if I told you, I know where she went?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;d tell you to just leave me alone!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I could tell you, but it\u0026#39;ll cost ya!\u0026#34; Touka said, ignoring Baby\u0026#39;s pleas. Baby looked shocked. Of course Touka wouldn\u0026#39;t just do anything just to be nice. \u0026#34;How about 1000 gems!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s not fair!\u0026#34; Baby shouted. \u0026#34;Who even has that much!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Okay fine, but I\u0026#39;m not going to make this easy!\u0026#34; Touka responded, \u0026#34;How about I just tell you where some else who saw her went?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;You should just tell us where Yayoi is?\u0026#34; Baby huffed.\n\u0026#34;Where\u0026#39;s the fun in that,\u0026#34; Touka teased. \u0026#34;Why not go find a pink haired cleric in a forest and see if she knows where your mama is!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Which other forest? There\u0026#39;s a ton of them!?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know, but I know it is not far!\u0026#34;\nThe group of friends decided to take Baby to the Forest of Mist since it was very close to the Sea of Greed and, mostly by chance, they happened across a certain cleric that definitely fit Touka\u0026#39;s description.\n\u0026#34;Tama-mama!\u0026#34; Baby cried.\n\u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s wrong Baby?\u0026#34; Tama asked\n\u0026#34;Touka is being mean again…but that\u0026#39;s not the real problem.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;We\u0026#39;re looking for Yayoi,\u0026#34; Narumi, one of the friends, interjects.\n\u0026#34;Oh my goodness, you lost Yayoi!\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Uh huh,\u0026#34; whimpered Baby.\n\u0026#34;Well, I did see her,\u0026#34; Tama explains, \u0026#34;but that was awhile ago. She looked like she was frantically searching for something. Maybe it was you.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Where was she looking?\u0026#34; inquired Narumi.\n\u0026#34;Well, I saw her in Vine Tomb, but I\u0026#39;m sure she was headed for a gate. Not sure which one, but I\u0026#39;m certain she\u0026#39;s not in Vine Tomb anymore.\u0026#34;\nThe group begins to deliberate. There are two gates in that area, but they decide to head to Dark Passage. They couldn\u0026#39;t find her there, but, since someone mentioned Moonlight Tomb, Narumi decided to head there ahead of everyone. She hears Yayoi shouting for Baby and informs the rest of her friends, who all head over to her.\n\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m so happy you found Baby again!\u0026#34; Yayoi exclaims.\n\u0026#34;Yayoi!\u0026#34; Baby cries.\nYayoi explains that she got separated from Baby and, instantly, and frantically started looking for her, eventually ending up in Moonlight Tomb where Narumi, and her friends, found her. She\u0026#39;s so happy to see BabyYayo again and vows to keep a better eye on her in the future. We shall see!\n","description":"Yayoi has lost BabyYayo! Can her friends help her find her!","id":1,"section":"adventures","tags":["story","fun","friends"],"title":"第一章: Babyは何処ですか!?","uri":"http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/jp/adventures/stories/ch1/"},{"content":" The easiest way to level these characters is to have a higher level character kill certain mobs for you while you are in the party. Their are so-called power levelers (plvlrs) who will do this for in-game money or you can find me and I\u0026#39;ll do it for free, if I have the time. The fastest mobs are the Cursed Knights in Flaming Mine (I can help get your characters here to if you need me to), but there is often a full exposition here of babies being leveled, often by a paid plvlr. If you can\u0026#39;t get a spot I suggest having someone kill Guardian Masters for you. This is still fairly fast and there are several spots this can be done at. This is my favorite way to level. It isn\u0026#39;t as fast or exciting as FM, but it does the trick.\nIf this isn\u0026#39;t an option for you, or you\u0026#39;d rather take your time and experience the various areas of the game, then there are quests you can do at this level. All the regular quests are fairly easy and fast up to about level 30. In fact, in my opinion, this is the most fun way to level especially if you have a friend or two to level babies with. Below are a few repeatables you can do together to make things faster, especially after level 30, if you want 😉\nRepeatable Quests (level 1-39) Despicable Little Ones - Little Hobs - Level 10 The Mini Greenky - Mini Greenkies - Level 11 Disease Carriers - Ratman - Level 12 Medical Herbs - Ratman with Herb Leaf - Level 12 Working for Karl - Broken Blade from Hooligan Phinoflies with Copper Ore (NQ and LQ) - Level 12 Clam Chowder - Boogy - Level 13 The Apple Thieves 2 - Boogy with Boogie\u0026#39;s egg from them - Level 13 - Available after completeting The Apple Thieves 1 Joker Kebings 2 - Joker Kebing - Level 18 - Available after completing Joker Kebings 1 Speedy Boogy 2 - Speedy Boogy - Level 18 - Available after completing Speedy Boogy 1 Herb Plant Set 2 - Herb Leaf, Herb Stem, and Herb Root (from gathering herbs) - Level 25 - Available after Herb Plant Set 1 Insomnia 2 - Glow Wolf - Level 25 - Available after completing Insomnia 1 Forzen Ice Cream 2 - Ice Vivi with Soft Ice Bits from them - Level 28 - Available after Frozen Ice Cream 1 The Oppression of Ghosts - Ghosts - Level 37 Harvest 2 - Hoes from Hobs - Level 38 - Available after completing Harvest 1 Bone Imp Bags 3 - Bone Imp Bags from Bone Imps - Level 39 - Available after completing Bone Imp bags 2 What to do at level 40? Those were not all the repeatable quests and you probably won\u0026#39;t need to complete a majority of them to reach level 40. For more information on quests you can visit the Fiesta Wiki. This will also help you complete pre-requisite quests for some of the reps above. Once your baby hits level 40 it is time for the Tower of Iyzel. Just because they are level 40, however, doesn\u0026#39;t mean that can beat the tower on their own. If you have a few friends, this could be pretty easy, but, if not, I should have an runner that can help you. Head to Roumen, visit Templar Maria and pick up all the quests that mention the tower than find a runner or get your party together and head to Forest of Mist to find the tower itself. With all the quests picked up, one run should get you to level 41 or 42. Congrats, you\u0026#39;re not a baby anymore 🥳!\n","description":"Babies are levels 1-40","id":2,"section":"fiesta","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Babies","uri":"http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/jp/fiesta/lvling/babies/"},{"content":" If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.\nFrom this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently. In some cases you can gain up to four levels in a less than an hour, if you can catch the right quests. For now though, it is best to exploit Tower of Iyzel to get you to 41 or 42 than you should run around completing various 40-42 level quests until you reach level 43.\nHow best to exploit repeatables from level 43-80, in Yayoi\u0026#39;s opinion There are many leveling guides available. Each guide seems to have its own way of doing things and there are a lot of arguments over what is the best way to level a character. This is simply how I like to do things. If you are in a guild academy and managed a discord invite, see if your guild has a guide and feel free to experiment.\nLevel 43-44 Complete the quest \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; This will require you to 8 Gobling Swordman and pick up 3 Goblin Swords that they drop. Once you turn in \u0026#34;A bet with Marty 1\u0026#34; you will unlock the quest \u0026#34;A Bet with Marty 2\u0026#34;. This requires you to pick up 5 Goblin Swords from Goblin Swordsman and kill 10 of those mobs. This is a repeatable to quests. After a few turn ins you should be level 44 easy. Gobling Swordman are fairly easy mobs and can be solo\u0026#39;d by characters at this level. For clerics, however, I highly recommend you gather them while a friend kills em. Don\u0026#39;t forget to heal your friend if they need it. Level 45-49 The repeatable above will still be available, but you will also gain access to two more repeatable quests at level 44, \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;. These both require items from the same mob so they can be used at the same time. \u0026#34;Fantastic Items\u0026#34; requires you to get 15 Warebear\u0026#39;s Claws from Ware Bears while \u0026#34;Best Broomsticks 3\u0026#34;, available after completing the first two \u0026#34;Best Broomstick\u0026#34; quests requires 15 Warebear Armbit Hairs. Ware Bears are a bit tougher, but can probably still be solo\u0026#39;d by all classes accept clerics.\nLevel 49-52 At level 49, you can head to Scaffold Execution Ground through the Collapsed Prision portal. Right at this portal is a mob called Mini Lips. These will drop \u0026#34;Mini Lips\u0026#39; Lips\u0026#34; if you have the quest \u0026#34;Mannequin Lips\u0026#34;. Pick up 10 of these and turn in. Repeat until you reach level 52.\nLevel 52-55 Scaffold Execition Grounds also has a rather large pack of King Colls. These will drop \u0026#34;King Donkey Teeth\u0026#34; when you have the quest \u0026#34;The Unbreakable Chisel\u0026#34;. You can pick up this quest from the quest list at level 52. This is a fairly easy and quick (especially with a killer) way to get to level 55.\nLevel 55-60 Both Collapsed Prision and Scaffold Execution Grounds have prisioners, there are more of them in large groups in Collapsed prision. As part of the Level 55 quest \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prision 1\u0026#34; you need to kill ten of them. Once you turn this quest in, you can pick up \u0026#34;Escape from Concealed Prison 2\u0026#34;. You now need to kill 20 prisioners for a turn in, but this is a repeatable and a fairly easy way to reach level 60.\nLevel 60 Unfortunately, many of the above quests have expired or simply don\u0026#39;t provide enough experience to help you get to level 61, so now you can do all the other quests you\u0026#39;ve neglected up until now. Have fun 😝!\nLevel 61-64 The zombie crystal rep in Crystal Cave is the quickest way to clear these three levels. It does have a few prequests though, and will require a party. I should have a CC runner to help you though.\nSecond Tower 1 Second Tower 2 What I do? Reward for Dark Crystal 3 (this is the repeatable) Level 64 You know all those quests you didn\u0026#39;t do because you will killing zombies (or, more likely, having zombies killed) in CC. Yeah, do those until you get to 65. Really only need to do the 61-64 quests, save your old 5x quests for later 😉.\nLevel 65-67 Greenkies repeat is the easiest way to clear this two levels. Do get you need to clear \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 1\u0026#34;. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Dreadful Forest Elf 2\u0026#34;\nLevel 68 Do those old level 5x quests I mentioned before. Save the remaining level 6x quests though.\nLevel 69 Do the level 6x quests now. Alternatively there is also the mud rep. It is much easier to do this rep now than it was when I first came back and many guides still omit it. Truthfully, I would only use it if I need a few more exp to get to 70, but its always there if you need it. It is called \u0026#34;Hair Remover\u0026#34; and is available at level 68, no prequests needed.\nLevel 70 Your best bet, KKP KQ. Bonus, this is a fairly popular and easy KQ. Just a few of these and you should be Level 71 easy. Also, be on the look out for vendors in Uruga buying some of the rewards, they pay more than the NPCs 😉.\nLevel 71-74 Navar rep. Seriously fast with a good party or a good killer. You will need to complete \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 1\u0026#34;, which requires you to gather 10 Navar Merc Liscences that the Nevars will occasionally drop and turn this back into Warrior Master Marty in Elderine (did I forget to mention that regular quests can no longer be turned in at the quest list as of level 60, personally, I hate that). Once you\u0026#39;ve done that you can pick up \u0026#34;Navar Mercenaries 2\u0026#34; from Marty and only count the kills.\nLevel 74-76 Do any Level 6x quests you may still have as well as your level 7x quests up until this point. If this isn\u0026#39;t quite enough to push you into level 77, than KKP is still available to help.\nLevel 77-79 Okay, well, hopefully, you\u0026#39;ve managed to pick up some friends by now, or you\u0026#39;re part of a guild academy, or your really outgoing, or I\u0026#39;m free. You can continue to do KKP all the way to 80, if, you want, but its going to be getting slow by now. My suggestion is the Lizard Knight rep. Its best to have a party with this one though. Your party should have a killer (a mage or archer that can kill groups of Lizardman Knights at once), a mob herder (someone to run around on a +1 or better mount and gather the Lizardman Knights) and at 0-3 additional party members (these will help additional items spawn and we call them droppers) all with the quest. In the right conditions you can get to 79 vary quickly. The repeatable is \u0026#34;Monster Collector 2\u0026#34;, and its available once you have turned in \u0026#34;Master Collector 1\u0026#34;\nLevel 79 Nix rep. This one is fairly quick. The quest is called \u0026#34;Slay the Fire Nix\u0026#34;. Fire Nixes can be killed by a character at this level with some ease, but, as always, gathering them and having someone kill them with an AOE is much faster.\nMore Information As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for details on every quest. Congrats, you aren\u0026#39;t a newblet any more 🥳!\n","description":"Newblets are still figuring things out, but they ain't babies no more. These are characters leveling 41-80 and probably having fun getting ready for, or currently playing KKP KQ.","id":3,"section":"fiesta","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Newblets","uri":"http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/jp/fiesta/lvling/newblets/"},{"content":" If you have followed my guides so far then you\u0026#39;ll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.\nHow best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too. For this stage I\u0026#39;m going to give you a few options for some of the levels. If you have the friends and money they\u0026#39;ll help you level really quickly, if you don\u0026#39;t than you can still solo, or work with a group of close friends your level, and still level, but it\u0026#39;ll be slower.\nLevel 80-90 There is a repeatable for gathering armor pieces in DT. You can have a higher level friend or a DT runner and a few droppers run through DT with you. Make sure you inventory is nearly empty and just fill it with these armor pieces. Once full, leave the dungeon and spam turn ins. Rinse and repeat until your level 90. Don\u0026#39;t forget to get the DT Key and quests. Alternatively, you can just do all the level 7x quests. There are a few somewhat boring reps mixed in there to help you get to 90. The slow way Here are the reps you can do to help you get to 90 if you can\u0026#39;t do DT for some reason:\nLevel 81-86 - Miner Mole Rep - \u0026#34;I Despise Moles\u0026#34; Level 82-87 - Another Mole Rep - \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s Them Again (Repeatable Quest)\u0026#34; Level 84-88 - Kidmon Rep - \u0026#34;Hans in Love\u0026#34; Level 85-88 - Toy Spade Rep - \u0026#34;Kidmon The Menance\u0026#34; Level 86-89 - Jewel Tree Rep - \u0026#34;Tree of Jewels\u0026#34; Level 89-90 - Lava Gargoyle Rep - \u0026#34;Attack of the Lava Gargoyles\u0026#34; Level 90-105 You can now enter Leviathan Nest. You need to complete the quest \u0026#34;Lost Key to the Lighthouse\u0026#34; to get the key. This requires you to slay Nest Slime, which is kinda strong for its level, best to have a friend help. Once here you have the key, you can find a guildie, friend, or other LN runner and just stand around and gather exp. This is nice because you can level while you AFK like in FM, but it can be expansive because runners don\u0026#39;t run it for free, usually. Alternatively, there is a non-LN strategy that is not as easy and is a bit slower, but more than doable. Also, at this point you may begin to do daily quests from the Hunter\u0026#39;s Union. These will allow you to earn tokens to exchange for items and give you a bit of exp every day! The slow way Level 90-94 - RS Rep - Complete the following: \u0026#34;Burning Cave\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Burning Cave 2\u0026#34; to unlock \u0026#34;My hunches never proves wrong\u0026#34; - Rock Stone is also hard to kill for someone at this level, but I love killing RS so just get in-touch with me, or you can have another high level guildie or friend kill it for you while you turn in the rep. Level 94-95 - Mandrake Rep - \u0026#34;Outlaw of the Swamp (Repeatable)\u0026#34; - 15 Kill per turn in now! Much better than doing all the other quests, but you could still do those if you want. Level 96-97 - King Rhino Rep - \u0026#34;The Threats of King Rhinoce\u0026#34; - Pretty easy mini-boss, may even be able to solo him, but a higher level killer is faster. Level 98 - do all the 9x quests to get you to 99, if you\u0026#39;re having difficulty reaching 99 even with daily quest and these normal quests, there is also the Ping Pig Horn rep - \u0026#34;Food Thief\u0026#34;, but this is a drop quest and can be difficult to in a party, so it is not recommended. Level 99-101 - Slugs rep - \u0026#34;Personal Revenge\u0026#34; Level 101-104 - Mad slugs rep - \u0026#34;Suspicious Big Mudmen\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Fire on Hands and Feet\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Unextinguishable Fire\u0026#34; Level 102-106 - BB rep - \u0026#34;Black Bear Beatdown\u0026#34; Level 105 If you did LN above, then just do the BB rep mentioned in the slow way to get you to 106.\nLevel 106-108 Okie, most of the shortcuts are done now so, no matter what, you\u0026#39;re going to have to grind a bit. Fortunately it isn\u0026#39;t really hard. Just remember that a lot of people are going to be doing these quests, see if you can join a party with a dedicated killer and this will go much faster. For these levels, you have the Fire Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Playing with Fire\u0026#34;).\nLevel 109 Complete all quests you\u0026#39;ve saved until this point. If you haven\u0026#39;t had to do the 9x quests than this will be very quick. Otherwise, the quests in OLT are here and they are also fairly quick with any other quests you saved up. OLT is best tackled with a party though.\nLevel 110-111 Nepu Nepu Neeeeep! Its time for the Nep rep. Complete \u0026#34;Collecting Twister Crystals\u0026#34; before getting the repeatable version. Believe it or not, there is nothing to collect for this rep, just killing.\nLevel 112-116 Either Mean Leipoons (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 1\u0026#34;) or Shellas rep (\u0026#34;Threats for Temporary Settlement 2\u0026#34;). It is important to note that you will have to completely The Mean Leipoons rep a few times before the Shellas rep shows up. Its weird, but true.\nLevel 116-118 Wrenches rep. Unfortunately, this quest is buried under a loooong list of prequests, but here they are: \u0026#34;Milly\u0026#39;s Healthy Wonder Medicine 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Unknown Causes.. However\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Noisy Animals 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. Once these are complete you\u0026#39;ll get the repeatable version of \u0026#34;Special Wrenches\u0026#34;. It should also be noted that you can make a ton of money by doing \u0026#34;The Workshop Master is making a weapon\u0026#34; (available at 117) while you are doing the wrenches rep, not to mention this boosts your exp too.\nLevel 118-121 Junks rep. This is also buried under a loooong list of prequests (but it is worth it! these quests will give you a lot of exp and the rep gives 2-3% per turn it 😲), so I\u0026#39;ll give you those too. \u0026#34;Smart Yeti is preparing for an Exam\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Something urgent came up to Hilda\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Sick Akisha\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;North Witch\u0026#39;s dark power\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Pagel\u0026#39;s voice 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Someone can help us..

After aaall these quests, you\u0026#39;ll finally get \u0026#34;Selling Junks\u0026#34;\nI\u0026#39;ve learned something just recently. There are a quite a few quests that you can do during this level, including a ton of repeatables. Junks is, by far, the fastest way, but it can be dangerous because of all the Astan\u0026#39;s nearby. For this reason I recommend having a good party with someone tanky to pull and a good killer that could, if needed, one-shot the Astans if they get close. Bonus, a party should be able to tell you exactly where to stand, sit on your mount, or rest during the rep to minimize your likelihood of dying, however, if you don\u0026#39;t have a lot of friends, there are easier, but slower reps. As I mentioned, a TON of them. Just don\u0026#39;t get discouraged by how slow you gain exp. Also, if your in a guild that likes to do Siren\u0026#39;s Castle raids and has a few good runners, ask if you can tag along for quests. This will be a good way to gain looots of exp at once, but be sure they are okay with you joining and it would probably good to spend some money on scrolls, tevas and charms, don\u0026#39;t forget to grab all the dungeon quests, they should have a sword icon!\nCongrats You are now a bone-fide adventurer. You are still 20 levels away from cap, but keep it up! As always, you can visit the Fiesta Wiki for more information on any of the quests above.\n","description":"Fledging Adventurers are characters from level 81-120, not their yet, but almost.","id":4,"section":"fiesta","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Fledgling Adventurers","uri":"http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/jp/fiesta/lvling/fledgling/"},{"content":" After following my guide thus far you\u0026#39;ll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamigo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you\u0026#39;ve gotten yourself into a good guild and have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.\nHow Best to Exploit repeatables from 121 to cap, according to Yayoi Okay, okay, all of the reps from here on, well from 116 on really, have a looooooooot of prequests, but they are pretty much essential for leveling now, so there isn\u0026#39;t much you can do about it, sadly. Just hunker down, grab some friends, and grind, grind, grind.\nLevels 121-123 Do the Beaks and Shellas repeat (if you can\u0026#39;t tell there are too many different types of Shellas in this game 😆). To get this repeat complete these quests in this order. \u0026#34;Embarrassed Basilone\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone is avoiding to answer\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Bailone\u0026#39;s Colleagues\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues belongings 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Present for Jey\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Jey\u0026#39;s Colleague\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Basilone\u0026#39;s Lie\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Suspicious Basilone\u0026#34;. That is seriously a lot 😵‍💫, but it will unlock \u0026#34;Continues Suspicion\u0026#34;, a fairly good rep, and give you quite a lot of exp to boot, so it isn\u0026#39;t all bad.\nLevels 124-125 There are actually quite a few reps here, including one that a lot of people will probably tell you about where you just go and gather a special type of wood. This rep is slow, very slow, without droppers and the rest of the reps are also pretty slow, so you can look em up in the Fiesta Wiki if you\u0026#39;d like, but I prefer to just run around and quest here. There are lots of quests you have saved to this point and they should be more than enough to get you to 125. Also, there is the Bajou Sancturary KQ, so that can help.\nLevels 125-126 Again, the rep here is slow, so quest and do BS KQ. If you don\u0026#39;t quite make it to 126, or you\u0026#39;re tired of running around complete these prequests: \u0026#34;Ancient Scriptures (1-5)\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Oh Captain, My Captain! (1-7)\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;The Arrival”\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Lending A Hand\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Nighttime disturbance\u0026#34;. After that, you\u0026#39;ll gain two reps \u0026#34;Their Health Is In Danger\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Nighttime disurbance\u0026#34;. In the right spot, both reps can be done together.\nLevels 127-128 Mushies rep. This rep takes 6-8 hours with a full party of droppers (be nice and save the quest so you can be a dropper for others). To get this rep you only need to complete the \u0026#34;Mushrooms for Ursula\u0026#34; prequest. Note (because no one told me this): You will need one basket from the item merchant in Isle of Eya for the prequest and then a second one for the rep. Just make sure to keep the basket in your inventory until your done.\nLevels 128-130 The second wood rep. This is much faster than mushies, but is still better with a full party of droppers. Just look for \u0026#34;Serben and His Woods\u0026#34;. The first will be a non-repeatable, turn it back into to Serben to get the repeatable version.\nLevels 130-135 From this point until cap, you will want to make sure you complete your daily quests and compete in available KQs. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 game time. You have some rep options to help fill your time.\nLevel 130-131 - \u0026#34;Success is everything\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 1\u0026#34; Level 130-132 - \u0026#34;Front Lines\u0026#34; Level 132-134 - \u0026#34;The Predator Leader\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 2\u0026#34; Level 134-135 - \u0026#34;The Final Ingredient\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;Helping Yuna 3\u0026#34; Final Note: The 135 reps are very slow. Focus on your dailies and KQS and complete any quests you haven\u0026#39;t done those far (aside from those your dropping for) to help move things a bit faster.\n","description":"Bone-fide adventurers are characters leveling from 121-135, these are their stories","id":5,"section":"fiesta","tags":["guide","leveling","quests"],"title":"Bone-fide Adventurers","uri":"http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/jp/fiesta/lvling/adventurer/"},{"content":" When I first wrote my last guide the level cap was actually 135 so I said congratulations now figure out what to do next. Well cap is 140 now so I guess it\u0026#39;s time for an update to the guide 😉. Sadly progress is slow and you know longer have any KQs to help you out. So, mayhap, you really don\u0026#39;t want to try, but in case you think capping might be cool, here\u0026#39;s some ideas of what you can do. The same caveat exists with this guide as with the last one. My current highest level character is only 133, so I have not tried any of these suggestions. If you would do try them let me know in the forums if they work for you, or let me know if you have other suggestions!\nDailies, Dailies, Dailies, and more Dailies Your best bet for a while at least is to continue to do the dailies you\u0026#39;ve been doing up until this point. As I said above, there are no KQs for passed 135 that offer any significant amount of exp, however, many of the hidden dailies and other daily quests you got when you got to 132 are still viable passed 135 and offer some exp. A member of one a guild I am in has broken down the amount of exp, in percentage, that you receive for various levels passed 135. Please note: this is the percentage if you complete all available dailies quests, not the percentage per quest!\n135 - 16.70% 136 - 13.22% 137 - 11.02% 138 - 9.07% 139 - 4.60% New Reps! There are new reps for you to complete as well. Well a couple anyway.\nYuna 3 (135-136) Soul Rep (136-138) Bug Rep (138-139) Questing The fiesta wiki offers a few options for quests for this level range. It has been recommended to relay on dailies and reps until at least 139. This will allow you to save your quests for when normal quests are suuuper in-effective, and hopefully make that last level just a little faster.\nSuggestions This guide is currently rather incomplete 😅. This is why I have forums! Please submit any other suggestions you have or ways you can think to expand this guide. I will also be expanding it has I try these suggestions. As I said, my max level is 133, but I\u0026#39;m slowly making progress and I\u0026#39;m working with someone who is already above level 135 so it won\u0026#39;t be too long.

Since Gamingo likes to make money bundles and stones used to enhance weapons, armor, and jewlery need to match their tier. So, say you have a tier 2 bow and you want to make it +1, you will need a tier 2 elrue. A tier 5 shield will need tier 5 stones. For your reference:\nTier 1 refers to level 1~20 items Tier 2 refers to level 20~50 Tier 3 to 51~80 Tier 4 to 81-99 Tier 5 to 100+ Tier 6 is rserved for lgendary weapons. Enhacement Breakage When enhancing and item, there is a possibility it will break. However, some items seem to have a kind of safe zone in which they won\u0026#39;t break until a certain point. There is still a chance of downgrading, but that doesn\u0026#39;t cause you to lose the item like breaking. Here are the safe zones:\nGenerally best to follow the rule of safe until +3, but here are the more specific safe zones:\nTier 1 never break up to +5 Tier 2 and Tier 3 don\u0026#39;t break until +4 Tier 4 and Tier 5 don\u0026#39;t break until +3 Maximum Enhancement Just how high can you enhance items? Depends on the type\nAccessories: Tier 1-5 can be enhanced to +9 Armor: Tier 1-5 can be enhanced to +10 Shields: Tier 1-5 can also go to +10 Weapons: Tiers 1\u0026amp;2 can only go to +10 while 3-5 can go upto +12 Note: You will need a special stone called \u0026#34;Karis\u0026#34; to go past +9\nStones These are the types of stones you need. The tier of the stone needs to be equal to the tier of the item, as mentioned above.\nTier 1-5 enhacement stones for weapons, gears, and accessories\nElrue: +1, +2, and +3 Lix: +4, +5, and +6 Xir: +7, +8 and +9 Karis: +10, +11, and +12 These stones come in tree colors:\nGreen are normal, they have no special effects and will increase by +1 Purple are Blessed, they have a higher chance of upgrading by +1 and even a very small chance of upgrading +2 Blue are lucky their chance of upgrade is lower than blessed, but it has a higher chance to upgrade by +2 As a general rule NEVER use a lucky elrue when your enhancing a +2 weapon or gear at tier 4 or 5! According to users of the forums: \u0026#34;The chance of breakage is low, but it CAN HAPPEN, and it happened with a lot of us.\u0026#34;\nAs Tier 6 weapons are special they use a special enhacement stone called \u0026#34;Crystal of bijou\u0026#34; for all of their stages (+1 ~ +12)\nBracelets also use a special \u0026#39;stone\u0026#39; for enhancing. I haven\u0026#39;t had much experience with bracelets, but I\u0026#39;ll list what I know:\nTier 1-4 bracelets use fragements of bijou\nTier 1: +1 - +5 Tier 2: +1 - +10 Tier 3: +1 - +15 Tier 4: +1 - +20 This fragments are also colored:\nLight blue are brilliant and will NOT break and item, but they have chance to downgrade and fail Pink are radiant and will not break or downgrade, but can still fail Rainbow are splendid and do not break or downgrade and has a 30% success rate Note radiant and splendid are cash store items.\nSC Enhacement Stones These are often purchased in bundles (as this is much more affordable) so people use call these bundles.

Each class is best suited to a particular role such as Damange Dealer (DD), Damage over Time (DoT), Area of Effect (AoE), Tank, or Support. I won\u0026#39;t go into details as to which class works best in which role as that is laid out very well on Fiesta\u0026#39;s Main Site. However builds can be tricky since each class has its own strength and weaknesses while its leveling such that what works for Archers my not work for Mages (even though they both specialize in AoE). So, here are the generally accepted builds and what classes to use with them 😉.\nAll STR This is easy as from the start, you just dump all of your skill points into STR. At first this seems like a really good build for all characters, but a character without DEF dies 😵. One might be tempted to use this for a tank role, but tanks are supposed to take dmg not give it. Really the only classes where this build works is Crusader, as they have good DEF by default and also have support skills, and Fighter (Gladiator Specifically) that focus more on DD roles than tanking.\nClasses: 🗡🛡👻🏹\nFull END Like All STR, full END just has you dump all of your points in one stat, in this case END. This will maximize your health and defenses. This is well suited for support classes, especially clerics, and tanks. People tend do die if the clericor tank dies so the more defense and HP they have the better.\nClasses: 🛡🗡✝️\nTotally DEX Dumping all your points into DEX may seem odd, but some classes can really utilize this well. Besides who needs DEF if the mobs can\u0026#39;t even hit you 🤪. Keep in mind though, you are sacrificing your potential in other areas. This really only makes since when you can kill fairly quickly too, so only DDs really, and you will still need some DEF. Just be careful with this one.\nClasses: 👻🏹\nPure SPR I\u0026#39;m listing this just because its a possibility to maximize your character\u0026#39;s SP, M.DEF, and crit rate, but you will need very good gear or you still won\u0026#39;t do much dmg and will probably die a lot too 😅.\nClasses: 🧙🏹\n33 DEX/Rest STR The above DD build (All STR) is great, but it ignores aim. Sprinkling in a few points to SPR, until you have 33 (or maximum of 67) fixes this helping your DD hit more often. This build is well suited for all those recommended for the All STR builds.\nClasses: 🗡🛡👻\n25 SPR/Rest END The above support build (Full END) is also great, but it ignores SP and crit rate. You can sprinkle in a few points into SPR until you have 25 to fix this, I highly recommend this build for Holy Knights since they tend to burn through available SP, also anyone in a support role can use some extra crits when they need to solo 😉.\nClasses: 🛡🗡✝️\n25 SPR/33 DEX/Rest STR This build maximize your attack power and crit rate while making it you a hard target to hit. You can use gear to help with DEF and M.DEF.\nClasses: 🏹🧙👻\n50 END/33 DEX/25 SPR/Rest STR If you\u0026#39;re looking for a wellrounded build that is nearly perfect for player-versus-player (PVP), this is the build for you. A reminder though, this is a jack-of-all-trades/master-of-none type situation, and many classesw have gear and armor to help with stats like END.\nClasses: 🛡🏹🧙👻\n","description":"A basic overview of the types of builds in Fiesta Online","id":10,"section":"fiesta","tags":["guide"],"title":"Builds","uri":"http://localhost:1313/~yayoi/jp/fiesta/builds/"}]
